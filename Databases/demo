Vestibular Aqueduct/*pathology
%X The present report describes three familial cases of recessive hearing loss associated with enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA). Six siblings from three families showed EVA. The common characteristic of these patients was the presence of congenital, high-frequency, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss. These cases suggest that EVA may be a useful discriminator between different types of recessive hearing loss.

%X A perilymph fistula is an abnormal communication between the fluids surrounding the membranous labyrinth and the middle ear space. Because of the potential hazards of meningitis, permanent hearing loss, and occasionally incapacitating vestibular symptoms, early recognition and prompt repair of the perilymph leak is important. One hundred thirty three cases of perilymph fistulas are presented, stressing the clinical characteristics, evaluation, and management of patients with this otologic entity. The historical and contemporary literature on this subject is reviewed. A pathophysiological basis for perilymph fistula formation is presented, based upon certain anatomic, physiologic and mechanical principles involving the temporal bone and surrounding structures. For the purpose of publication, the Materials and Methods and Evaluation sections of the paper have been omitted. These are available from the author upon request in mimeographed form. The interested reader may wish to refer to items 80 and 133 in the Bibliography, previous publications by the author in which the bulk of the data used in the omitted sections can be found.

%X Sensory intervention, one aspect in the occupational therapy treatment of the high-risk, preterm infant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), is discussed. Normal deviations in the healthy preterm baby's development at the equivalent age of the full-term baby are identified as a basis for intervention. Environmental factors affecting the preterm infant's interactions and therapeutic needs, such as the NICU environment and medical intervention, are reviewed. The rationale underlying the selection of sensory evaluation and treatment approaches is based on recent research. These approaches primarily focus on visual, tactile, proprioceptive, vestibular, and, to a lesser degree, auditory stimulation.

%X OBJECTIVE: Defects of the cochlear modiolus have been found to be associated with most cases of large vestibular aqueduct. The clinical significance of these modiolar defects has not been studied previously. The purpose of this article is to correlate clinical (functional) parameters, such as hearing outcomes, with the severity of the radiographic findings in these dysplastic inner ears. STUDY DESIGN: The study design was a retrospective chart review, supplemented with telephone interviews and clinic visits. SETTING: The study was conducted at an academic, tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Thirty consecutive patients with large vestibular aqueducts participated. RESULTS: Scores of modiolar deficiencies yielded inconsistent correlations with hearing loss. Vestibular aqueduct morphology and thickness correlated very strongly with the severity of hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS: These observations support the hypothesis that large vestibular aqueduct-related hearing loss may be caused by transmission of subarachnoid pressure forces into the inner ear. However, the thickness and morphology of the vestibular aqueduct may simply be markers for more subtle cochlear dysplasia manifest by modiolar deficiency.

%X The vestibular system plays a major role in the expression of early motor behavior. Previous research has cited extensive neural connections between the vestibular apparatus and the motor system. Accordingly, some therapists have implemented programs of supplemental vestibular stimulation to improve motor and cognitive abilities in children with delayed motor development. In the present study a quantifiable regimen of supplemental rotary vestibular stimulation was administered in a cross-over longitudinal design to nonhandicapped and Down syndrome infants. Time constants, considered a measure of habituation in the vestibular system, were derived from postrotary nystagmus. Results indicated that supplemental rotary vestibular stimulation produced no measurable gain in motor ability beyond that evident in control periods. In addition, it was determined that children exhibited greater gains in motor skills in the early phase of the study, regardless of experimental condition. A positive correlation was found between changes in time constant and motor development.

We wish to present a method of primary nasal correction utilizing presurgical orthopedics with the Latham dentomaxillary advancement appliance, concomitant rotation- advancement cleft lip repair, gingivoperiosteoplasty, and immediate correction of the nasal cartilage distortion with an "open technique" utilizing the rotation-advancement incisions. Direct elevation and suture fixation of the cleft side alar cartilage is performed as well as recreation of the normal upper lateral/lower lateral cartilage relationship, repair of nasal web, and release of the vestibular lining utilizing an L-flap pedicled to the alar base. Details of the operative technique, observations of unilateral cleft nasal anatomy as visualized with the "open technique," and preliminary results are illustrated in patients followed as long as 5 years.

%X Gentamicin, as the other aminoglycosides, has a very narrow therapeutic index. The pharmaco-kinetics parameters in neonates depend on the renal maturation which is a function of post-conceptional age. Using an unit dose of 2 mg/kg and adapted time intervals, longer for premature babies and in the first week of life, the frequency of too high trough levels is decreased. A convenient method is proposed for determining when to reduce the time interval between injections. Audiotoxicity is both cochlear and vestibular and can be, only in part, detected by evoked potentials. Nephrotoxicity is initially, a tubular injury with an increase of enzymuria (NAG) and beta 2 microglobulinuria, followed by alterations of glomerular filtration. Blood concentrations monitoring is indicated in all gentamicin treated neonates.

%X Neurootological research demonstrated significantly different vestibulo- ocular reactions by infants and young children as compared to adults. Neurohistological research has demonstrated that the vestibular apparatus is developed by birth and therefore should be fully functional. Fifty full-term and healthy infants and children between 9 days and 24 months of age were placed on an electrically controlled rotating chair in order to determine the functional development of the vestibular system. The rotational test program consisted of a supraliminal acceleration stimulus of 3 degrees/s2, a constant rotation at 90 degrees/s for 3 minutes, and a final abrupt deceleration stimulus. The frequency and amplitude of the per- and post-rotatory nystagmus reaction were analysed from the electronystagmogram. The nystagmus frequencies demonstrate a low level in the first month. The per- and post-rotatory deviate clearly from each other in the following months. The amplitude values also start out low in the first month then climb thru the 7th month and finally stabilize or drop slightly in both the per- and post-rotatory phases. The accumulated results will be discussed and typical examples will be demonstrated.

%X The elderly show a general reduction of their bodily and mental reactions. They become slower to react and their sensory ability decreases, e.g. hearing, vision, smell and taste. With increasing age, disturbances of the balance system are found more frequently, resulting in dysequilibrium, vertigo, lightheadedness and falling. We investigated the physiological changes in the vestibular system associated with the ageing processes. We selected 470 patients aged from 1-90 years from 1500 routine neurological patients. All of these patients underwent a routine neuro-otological test battery including vestibular-spinal, caloric, rotatory and optokinetic tests with electronystagmographic recording. Vestibular ocular reactions change markedly over nine decades. The nystagmus reactions, expressed by frequency, amplitude and maximal slow phase velocity of children differ from those of adults and even more from those of the elderly. The quantitative nystagmus dynamics after caloric and rotatory stimulation are accompanied by qualitative changes of the nystagmus signal. With increasing age destructive signs appear which may produce unreadable electronystagmograms. The standing and moving pattern of the elderly patient is characterized by instability, slowness, tremor and ataxia. The results of the Romberg test show an increase of instability and unsteadiness in older patients. The Unterberger test, recorded by craniocorpography, demonstrates an increase of atactic patterns with increasing age. These changes are the result of age-related physiological changes in the sensory, cerebral, peripheral nervous and muscular systems.

%X Elderly persons are affected in addition to other findings, by an overall reduction of their bodily and mental reactions. Their sensory ability decreases, such as hearing, vision, smell, and taste. With increasing age disturbances of the balance system occur more frequently, resulting in disequilibrium, vertigo, light-headedness, and falling. - The aim of this study was to find out physiological changes in the vestibular system that are connected with aging processes. For this study we selected 470 patients from 1500 neurotologic routine patients of 1 to 90 years of age. All of these patients underwent a routine neurotologic test battery including caloric, rotatory, and optokinetic tests with electro-nystagmographic recording and vestibular spinal tests. The results show that vestibular ocular reactions change markedly during the period of nine decades. The nystagmus reactions, expressed by the nystagmus parameters of frequency, amplitude, and maximal slow phase velocity, of children differ from those of adults and more pronounced from those of aged persons. Quantitative nystagmus dynamics after caloric and rotatory stimulation are accompanied by qualitative changes of the nystagmus signal. Signs of destruction appear with increasing age that may lead to unreadable electronystagmograms. These changes are the result of age-related physiological changes occurring in the sensory, cerebral, peripheral nervous and muscular systems.

%X The interactive functions between sensory systems show changes that depend on the development of the growing body. Important conditions for the development of the visual suppression of vestibular evoked nystagmus reactions are the maturation of the visual system, the presence of a functioning vestibular system and close connections between both systems. Response to vestibular, visual and combined vestibular and visual stimulation does not only change during early childhood. We have also learnt from studies of adults of different ages that there are characteristic changes in nystagmus reactions to vestibular stimulation, in optokinetic reactions and in vestibular- spinal functions during the whole period of life. 272 randomly selected neuro-otologic routine patients aged between one year and four months and eighty-eight years and ten months were included in the study to analyse age-related changes of visual suppression during rotatory stimulation. The rotatory stimulation consisted of an sinusoidal stimulus pattern with amplitudes of +/- 180 degrees and a period duration of 20s. The vestibular stimulation was performed in total darkness and with a visual target which was attached to the chair in front of the patient's eyes. The results of this study demonstrate that the amplitudes of nystagmus reactions, evoked by sinusoidal harmonic acceleration, can be quantitatively suppressed by visual fixation. The degree of suppression depends on age. The fixation indices provide the ability to measure the degree of this suppression in percent. The trend to better fixation suppression increases up to the end of the age of forty. The ability to suppress vestibular nystagmus decreases, however, after reaching the fortieth year of life. The analysis of smooth pursuit shows after the sixtieth year of life a continuous rise in the number of saccades with increasing age. These changes are caused by aging processes in cerebral tissues which lead to functional changes e.g. in the interactive functions between sensory systems.

%X Meningitis is still one of the serious infectious diseases in clinical practise. In a high percentage of cases with this disease process, the auditory and vestibular parts of the inner ear are damaged. In this study the auditory and vestibular systems of 53 children and teenagers between 1.7 and 18.7 years of age were examined following meningitis. The mean time-interval between meningitis and examination was 5.8 years. Eighty-one of 106 ears examined showed sensorineural hearing losses which varied between mild hearing loss and total deafness. Peripheral vestibular lesions were found in 60 of 106 labyrinths examined. These varied between inhibition and total loss of function. In addition, we also found central vestibular lesions in 29 cases. Mild and moderate combined auditory and vestibular lesions could be verified in 23 ears, whereas profound functional disturbances or functional losses were found in 29 ears examined. Eight of 40 ears with hearing losses and 12 of 40 ears with peripheral vestibular lesions showed progression during follow-up. The findings of this study emphasize the need for auditory and vestibular diagnostic studies followed meningitis in children and teenagers. Patients and their families should be cared for on a long-term basis to avoid social and psychological problems.

%X Eleven cases of Hemophilus meningitis seen in the last year are reported. Three were H. parainfluenzae and eight were H. influenzae. The number of patients is small but probably indicates that there is little difference in the clinical or laboratory data in meningitis caused by these two organisms. The children with H. parainfluenzae tended to be less anemic and had more normal admission spinal fluid sugars and proteins, but this was probably because these patients were older and had shorter prodromes. As more cases of H. parainfluenzae meningitis are noted, it seems likely that there will not be any difference in the clinical or laboratory data. Two of the three cases of H. parainfluenzae meningitis had the complication of ataxia secondary to severe bilateral vestibular deficits. Finally, it should be noted that these two organisms will not be distinguished by routine bacteriological studies, and that differentiation must be carried out by an experimental laboratory.

%X The utriculo-endolymphatic valve (UEV) is located in the posterior wall of the utricle at its junction with the utricular duct and was first described in a human fetus by Bast in 1928. Although different theories about its normal position and function have been postulated, the function of the UEV remains unclear. In the present investigation we studied 118 temporal bones from 70 children to determine whether there were differences in the position of the valve and by inference, its function between children and adults. Premortem ages ranged from newborn to 10 years (mean age, 11.6 months). All temporal bones were fixed in 10% formalin, decalcified and processed by the celloidin technique. Specimens were sectioned in a horizontal plane at a thickness of 20 microns. Every tenth section was stained with hematoxylin-eosin and studied by light microscopy. The position of the UEV was then classified as closed or open. Valves damaged by preparation or having an uncertain position were classified as artifact. The chi-square test was used to determine a correlation between the position of the valve and the status of the rest of the endolymphatic system and whether or not endolymphatic hydrops was present in the cochlear and vestibular systems. The UEV was closed in 39 temporal bones (33.1%) and open in 13 (11.0%). Artifacts were found in 66 bones (55.9%). In the group of patients with a collapsed ductus reuniens the UEV was closed in 38% of the specimens, suggesting that the UEV prevented loss of endolymph from the pars superior, but these findings were not statistically significant.

%X Mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22q12 cause a clinically variable autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VSs), other nervous system tumors, and early onset lenticular cataracts. We studied three pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins with NF2, all with bilateral VSs, to separate genetic from nongenetic causes of clinical variability. The evaluation included gadolinium-enhanced high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of the head and spine, neuro-ophthalmic examination with slit lamp, physical examination, and zygosity testing with microsatellite markers. Each MZ pair was concordant for general phenotypic subtype (mild or severe) and often for the affected organ systems. However, the MZ pairs were discordant for some features of disease presentation or progression. For example, all three pairs were discordant for presence or type of associated cranial tumors. We hypothesize that phenotypic differences between NF2 MZ twins are at least partly due to stochastic processes, such as the loss of the second NF2 allele or alleles of other genes.

%X We report a case of bilateral temporal bone anomalies in a child with symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus infection and severe, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss identified at 3 months of age. High- resolution temporal bone computed tomography (HRCT) revealed bilateral findings of a short, malformed cochlea lacking an interscalar septum, a short and wide internal auditory canal, and an enlarged vestibular aqueduct, features diagnostic of bilateral Mondini dysplasia. To determine the importance of this observation, we completed HRCT in five additional children between 7 months and 9 years of age who had evidence of symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus infection. One child with profound sensorineural hearing loss had severe bilateral temporal bone dysplasia with a small cochlea lacking an interscalar septum, an abnormal vestibule, and a large cochlear aqueduct. Of the remaining four children, hearing thresholds ranged from normal to profoundly decreased, but their HRCT scans were normal to visual inspection. When inner ear dimensions of these temporal bones were compared with norms established by Pappas and coworkers, however, seven of the eight ears had short cochleas and narrow lateral semicircular canals, and three ears had short or narrow vestibules. These results indicate that congenital cytomegalovirus infection may cause anomalies or growth disturbances of the temporal bone.

%X Two sagittal surfaces were defined on the dry skull of 96 youngs and 51 adults Caucasian subjects in vestibular orientation. The surface of the face and the surface of the "total face" (by including the buccodental and mandibular surfaces) were measured with a planimeter. From the longest maxillary and zygomatic distances, the volume of two ellipsoids were calculated. The radius of a sphere corresponding to this volume was then deducted. Each sphere was then positioned taking the vestibular coordinates, corresponding to the barycenter of the sagittal surface, as the center. The ontogenetic evolution of these two points showed a curve similar to that of all the points in the splanchnocranium of man. Quantitative results are given for volumes and calculated data. The two facial spheres were then positioned relative to two known spheres in the neurocranium. The quadrilaterals drawn between the 4 centers denote a phylogenic constancy of the directions when compared with the results observed in man and those obtained in anthropoids.

%X The presentation to the Department of Pediatric Otolaryngology at the Children's Hospital of Michigan of a series of patients with sensorineural hearing loss and enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct prompted exploratory tympanotomy in three patients (two unilateral and one bilateral), for a total of four ears. These explorations were prompted by progression and/or fluctuation of hearing levels. The discovery of abnormal round windows in all four ears with a post- traumatic fistula present in one ear suggested the presence of a new association. A previously undescribed association of an enlarged vestibular aqueduct, sensorineural hearing loss and round window abnormality with potential fistula formation was identified. A review of the anatomy and physiology, literature review, and a prospective analysis with discussion of eight patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome evaluated and treated at Children's Hospital of Michigan, is presented. We conclude that all children with sensorineural hearing loss should undergo extensive evaluation to determine etiology, including radiographic studies of the temporal bone. Further, the presence of an enlarged vestibular aqueduct should prompt the otolaryngologist to consider the presence of a round window abnormality and the potential for predisposition to perilymph fistula.

This study was undertaken to document the genital anatomy of 211 girls between the ages of 1 month and 7 years who presented for well child care or nongynecologic complaints and who had no history of sexual abuse. Each child's genitalia was examined and photographed, with findings reported reflecting those observed photographically. The study population consisted of 36% blacks, 33.6% white non-Hispanics, 29.9% Hispanics, and 0.5% Asians. Subjects had a mean age of 21 +/- 20.6 (SD) months. Extensive labial agglutination sufficient to obscure the hymen was noted in 5% (10/211) and partial agglutination in an additional 17% (35/211). A significant difference was noted in hymenal configuration by age, with a fimbriated hymen the most common type (46%) in infants aged 12 months or younger and a crescentic hymen the most common (51%) in girls older than 24 months (P less than or equal to .001). No significant difference was noted in hymen configuration by race. Hymenal bumps (mounds) were observed in 7%, hymenal tags in 3%, vestibular bands in 98%, longitudinal intravaginal ridges in 25%, and external ridges in 15% of subjects in whom the anatomy under study could be visualized. Hymenal notches (clefts) occurred superiorly and laterally on the hymenal rim but none were found inferiorly on the lower half of the hymen. A narrow rounded hymenal ring with a transection was observed in only 1 (0.5%) of 201 subjects and was not considered a normal finding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

%X The histopathologic findings in 8 temporal bones from 5 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta congenita are reported. The otic capsule, bony walls of middle ear, and ossicles showed evidence of both deficient and abnormal ossification. Microfractures were found in the otic capsule and in the anterior process and handle of the malleus, in addition to their common location at the crura of the stapes. The cochlear and vestibular end-organs appeared normal. Pathologic changes compatible with otosclerosis were not seen. The possible implication of these changes on hearing and balance is discussed.

%X Thirty difficult-to-test children have been tested with transtympanic ECoG. When possible, informal hearing tests and/or free-field testing were performed. Children in whom no action potential (AP) could be recorded were submitted to conventional radiography of the inner ear, and vestibular tests. The correlation between free-field test thresholds and AP "thresholds" was good, especially in subjects with relatively good hearing. Response amplitude increased, and latency decreased, with increasing frequency of the stimulus implying that different parts of the basilar membrane are stimulated according to the frequency of the stimulus. Input-output curves of response amplitude and latency were plotted, and three different types were distinguished. ECoG can contribute to the evaluation of peripheral hearing in difficult-to-test children, and vestibular tests should always be performed on a child with suspected deafness or sensorineural hearing loss. Conventional radiography of the inner ear, however, seems to be of little value.

%X The pathology of congenital hearing loss is as varied as the etiologies. Severe external ear anomalies, such as microtia, and middle ear defects have a significant incidence of accompanying inner ear aplasias, more often of the vestibular than of the cochlear end-organs. Classic inner ear aplasias are discussed, including Michel, Mondini, Alexander and Scheibe. A case illustrating close resemblance between a genetically induced Scheibe malformation and rubella inner ear deformities is present. A variety of ear disorders acquired during intrauterine or neonatal life, including cytomegalic inclusion disease, hypoxia, erythroblastosis fetalis and later-onset genetic disorders are also discussed. Illustrative case histories are presented as well as priorities for future investigations into the pathology of congenital and genetic hearing loss.

%X Conductive, sensorineural and mixed hearing loss occur in osteogenesis imperfecta in autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Hearing loss is generally due to the middle and inner ear pathology of osteogenesis imperfecta and only occasionally to the coincidental association of otosclerosis and osteogenesis imperfecta. Two lesions cause the conductive hearing loss of osteogenesis imperfecta: (1) functional ossicular discontinuity due either to stapes superstructure fracture or fibrous replacement, or (2) thick, crumbly, lightly fixed stapes footplate. Cochlear hair cell loss, stria vascularis atrophy and calcification, tectorial membrane distortion and perilymph hemorrhage are autopsy findings that could account for sensorineural hearing loss, which occurs in a surprisingly high percentage of osteogenesis imperfecta patients. Hearing loss occurs earlier in osteogenesis imperfecta than in otosclerosis. Distinctive acoustic impedance and X- ray abnormalities occur in osteogenesis imperfecta. Other otologic findings may include lopped pinna, notching of the helix of the pinna, rosy flush of the medial wall of the middle ear and vestibular abnormalities.

%X Pediatric otolaryngology research, most of the time, relies on basic research in animals. This is especially evident when looking at the neonatal period on which this paper is mainly focused. Most of perinatal hearing pathologies are related to the existence of sensitive periods during development. Major improvements of evoked potential techniques have permitted early recognition of hearing losses. This paper also deals with problems involving secretory otitis media, laryngeal stenosis and drooling in crippled children. Finally, there is brief mention of future research domains: immunology and vestibular pathology.

%X OBJECTIVE: To study temporal bone histopathologic characteristics of the inner ear and middle ear cleft of patients with Down's syndrome. DESIGN: Sixteen temporal bones from eight patients with Down's syndrome were studied. Ten temporal bones from subjects without pathologic ear lesions but with congenital heart disease served as controls. The two- dimensional graphic reconstruction method proposed by Guild and modified by Schuknecht was used to study the cochleas; measurement of the vestibules was based on Igarashi's method. SETTING: The temporal bone collection of the Otitis Media Research Center, Department of Otolaryngology, University of Minnesota School of Medicine, Minneapolis. RESULTS: Six bones showed short cochlea, and four of six had Mondini's cochlea. The overall cochlear lengths in this study group were notably shorter than those of the controls. The spiral ganglion cell population and two of three vestibular dimensions also were notably less than the controls. Middle ear findings included residual mesenchyme, stapes abnormality, otitis media, and large facial canal dehiscence. CONCLUSIONS: The difficulties encountered in rehabilitation of patients with Down's syndrome caused by mental retardation can be compounded by the hearing loss caused by middle and inner ear abnormalities. A complete evaluation of hearing loss and therapy before starting the rehabilitation gives the most favorable outcome.

%X Clinically, the definitive diagnosis of perilymph fistulas can only be made by tympanotomy. Results of various fistula tests based upon the vestibulo-ocular reflex have not correlated well with findings during tympanotomy. A new fistula test has been developed based upon vestibulo- spinal responses. By systematic removal of both visual and support- surface orientation references from the subject--leaving only vestibular control of postural reflexes--patients with perilymph fistulas demonstrated an increased (sometimes phase-locked) postural sway in response to sinusoidal changes in external auditory canal pressures. Results from 100 consecutively operated ears (64 patients)-- 77 of whom underwent preoperative and postoperative moving-platform fistula tests--indicate that the test sensitivity is 97 percent for this highly selective patient population. Absolute specificity could not be determined because, on patients without clinical indications for surgery, tympanotomy is contraindicated.

%X Dizziness in childhood is not an infrequent symptom. Accurate history taking and close co-operation between otologist, paediatrician and neurologist are necessary in the approach to the dizzy child. Most cases of childhood dizziness settle in time and investigations should be carefully selected; those with severe and persistent dizziness or ataxia should be thoroughly investigated including: EEG, ENG, calorics and CT scan. The conditions causing dizziness in children are discussed and are illustrated with case histories from our series of 27 children. Dizziness of unknown aetiology, serous otitis media and benign paroxysmal vertigo were the most common diagnostic labels applied to our patients. Treatment is rarely necessary but dimenhydrinate or a labyrinthine sedative in those with troublesome vertigo, or the adjustment of the medical regime in those epileptics on phenytoin, may be beneficial. Surgical intervention is only required in those with an operable lesion.

%X The development of the visual contribution to postural stabilization has been tested using a large visual display rotating around the stationary subject's line of sight. This, in the adult, causes a marked optokinetic postural reaction with a shift of the body center of gravity toward the direction of pattern motion. Scalings of the reactions in children between 6 months and 16 years revealed three phases of development: (1) 6--12-month-old-babies show none or very little optokinetic disturbance of their newly acquired ability to sit. With the development of upright stance and gait, optokinetic influences become increasingly important. (2) Children between the age of 2--5 show a marked dependence of postural stability on vision. In them, the disturbing optokinetic stimulus leads to a marked ipsilateral postural deviation or irresistible fall. (3) From 5 to 15 years of age, visual effects on postural balance slowly decrease to their final strength in adulthood--moderate head and body tilt--in response to the rotating stimulus. It is concluded that the optokinetic loop participates rather late in the multisensory process of postural stabilization. The calibration of the three main loops, visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive, seems to be sequential and mutually interactive. Optimal functioning requires the continuous evaluation of the reafferent sensory consequences of self-generated body movements. Optokinetic destabilization of stance requires the maturity of opto- vestibulo-spinal pathways. Its clinical applicability as a maturity test, however, sofar seems limited.

%X Prenatal and perinatal correlates of abnormal auditory brainstem responses in neonates have been studied extensively. In contrast, vestibular function during the first year of life has received sparse attention. Using a specially modified vestibular test battery, 65 infants (17 low-risk, 48 high-risk) were initially evaluated during their first 6 months of life. Results revealed normal vestibular function in 46 infants (13 low-risk, 33 high-risk) and abnormal findings at either 3 or 6 months in 19 infants (4 low-risk, 15 high- risk). Correlations between vestibular results and variables such as auditory brainstem response results, birth history, and postnatal course in the neonatal intensive care unit were analyzed statistically. While some differences were mildly significant, none were highly significant. The lack of significant correlation between abnormal auditory brainstem response and vestibular results is of particular interest.

%X Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) which is sudden in onset, fluctuating, and/or progressive complicates medical management, hearing aid selection, and individualized educational planning for a hearing- impaired child. In spite of multidisciplinary evaluation and intervention, a gradual decrease in auditory acuity may continue unabated in a significant number of cases. Intercurrent middle ear disease and inconsistent audiologic technique can account for threshold variation in some cases. The study population consisted of 229 children (132 boys; 97 girls) aged 1 to 19.9 years at first audiogram which revealed at least a mild degree of sensorineural hearing loss in one or both ears (35 unilateral), and who demonstrated threshold variation of 10 dB or more in at least one ear at one or more of the standard audiometric test frequencies (250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 Hz) and were without concurrent middle ear disease (mean length of follow- up, 4.9 years; mean number of audiograms, 10.3). Of 365 ears demonstrating threshold variation of 10 dB or more, 22 (6%) had purely progressive losses without intercurrent upward fluctuation, 208 (57%) had fluctuating thresholds with gradually progressive losses, and 135 (37%) had intermittent threshold fluctuation without permanent deterioration. The probability of contralateral threshold fluctuation if one ear fluctuated was 0.91, while the probability of contralateral progressive SNHL if one ear progressed was 0.67. Demographic data, presumptive etiology, degree of initial SNHL, audiometric configuration, and symmetry of threshold variation were considered as potential predictors of the likelihood of threshold fluctuation and/or progression.

%X Infants with Down's syndrome are delayed in achieving motor milestones. When they first sit unsupported a discrepancy between visual and mechanical-vestibular indices of postural stability is less disruptive of their balance than in normal infants. Yet when they first stand unsupported, the same discrepancy disrupts balance more in these infants than in the normal infants. The effect of discrepant visual feedback also differs systematically as a function of the infants' experience of the posture. Monitoring posture in relation to a stable visual surround appears to be fundamental to the normal development of motor control.

%X If a drastic change in hearing has occurred in a child following a minor head trauma, change in barometric pressure, or physical exertion, large vestibular aqueduct syndrome (LVAS) should be considered. Most audiologists are unaware of LVAS or do not suspect it, in part due to the presence of a conductive component. LVAS can be seen in conjunction with Mondini's dysplasia or may appear by itself and is easily identified by a computed tomography scan. We present five cases of LVAS and discuss the natural history, audiologic and imaging findings, and relevant literature.

%X This single-subject research study with replication evaluated the effect of daily occupational therapy on the nutritive and nonnutritive sucking behaviors of three high-risk, premature infants. At the time of entrance into the study, the infants were 34 to 35 weeks old and were documented poor feeders. Treatment consisted of individual, multimodal sensory stimulation, with emphasis on proprioceptive and vestibular input, graded to the sensory needs of the infants. Movement components of the jaw and tongue during nutritive and nonnutritive sucking were measured during baseline and intervention phases to assess the infants' sucking ability. A comparison of testing results revealed that during intervention the total sucking scores improved significantly for two of the three infants and that rapid changes occurred in the oral-motor function of all three infants. The results of the study suggest that occupational therapy can improve the rate of development of sucking in the premature neonate. However, future research needs to be done to isolate the specific techniques of treatment that produce positive changes.

%X A 10-month-old girl presented with apparently unilateral ocular motor apraxia (OMA). Electro-oculography confirmed an inability to generate a saccade for fixation or in response to an optokinetic or vestibular evoked stimulus to the right. Fixation and optokinetic saccades and vestibular evoked nystagmus were present to the left. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a small cerebellar vermis but no localizing unilateral abnormality or tumour. Subsequent review of video recordings of 16 children with congenital OMA revealed that 5 demonstrated asymmetry in the generation of fixation saccades. Two of the five also demonstrated asymmetry of vestibular evoked nystagmus, and an additional child had optokinetic asymmetry.

%X The effects of brain-dominance in psychology, electrophysiology and the axial muscles are described. 1. Left-sided vascular hemispheric brain- distrubances, with or without aphasia, reduce, compared with arteriosclerotics, without focal signs, verbal, action-and total IQ, those on the right side only the action and total IQ. When comparing right- and left-sided frontal, frontoparietal and frontotemporal vascular disturbances - with or without a aphasia-, the left-sided frontotemporal lesions had a lower action- and verbal IQ, even if there were no signs of aphasia. In children aged between 12 and 40 months we found no correlation between the degree of motor dominance and mental development. Among children with delayed speech development--and therefore also in children with subnormal development--the number of lefthander was significantly higher than with the other children. 2. One can show electromyographically that, when a muscle is voluntarily contracted, there is simultaneous contraction of the same muscle on the other side. This contralateral motorspread happens more often from the stimulation of the dominant side to the subordinated side than vice versa. Ipsilateral somato-sensory cortical response is more common when stimulating the dominant than the subordinated ulnar nerve and develops ontogenetically parellel with right- or left-handedness. 3. Stabilographic registration can show a right-sided prevalence of swing of the vertical axis of the body, which probably is related to a lower irritability of the vestibular apparatus on galvanic stimulation. With the eyes open, the right-sided deviation of the bodyaxis increases which can be explained by greater functional strength of the right visuomoto system, which itself can be shown by the higher frequency of right-sided optocinetic nystagmus.

%X The distribution of somatostatin-immunoreactive structures in the infant brainstem was investigated using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique. A wide distribution of somatostatin-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers was observed throughout the brainstem. Numerous somatostatin-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers were present in several areas of the brainstem including the substantia grisea centralis and the reticular formation. Some immunoreactive cell bodies were seen in cranial nerve nuclei such as the nucleus praepositus, the nucleus nervi hypoglossi and the vestibular nuclei. Immunoreactive fibers were seen in the nucleus cuneatus, the locus coeruleus, the nucleus tractus solitarius, the nucleus ambiguus, the nucleus tractus spinalis nervi trigemini and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. These data were in agreement with previous works on the human adult. However, a high density of somatostatin-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in the interpeduncular nucleus and in the nucleus centralis superior, and a dense network of somatostatin-immunoreactive fibers in the dorsal part of the nucleus inferior olivarius, were also observed. The role of somatostatin in some brainstem nuclei and its probable implication in some specific neuropathological diseases of the infant brainstem is discussed.

Vestibular Diseases/*diagnosis/embryology
%X Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is characterized in part by mental impairment, as well as craniofacial and ocular anomalies. These conditions are traditionally associated with childhood hearing disorders, because they all have a common embryonic origin in malformations of the first and second branchial arches, and have similar critical periods of vulnerability to toxic insult. A review of human and animal research indicates that there are four types of hearing disorders associated with FAS. These are: (1) a developmental delay in auditory maturation, (2) sensorineural hearing loss, (3) intermittent conductive hearing loss due to recurrent serous otitis media, and (4) central hearing loss. The auditory and vestibular systems share the same peripheral apparatuses (the inner ear and eighth cranial nerve) and are embryologically and structurally similar. Consequently, vestibular disorders in FAS children might be expected. The evidence for vestibular dysfunction in FAS is ambiguous, however. Like other syndromes associated with craniofacial anomalies, hearing disorders, and mental impairment, FAS is also characterized by a high prevalence of speech and language pathology. Hearing disorders are a form of sensory deprivation. If present during early childhood, they can result in permanent hearing, language, and mental impairment. Early identification and intervention to treat hearing, language, and speech disorders could therefore result in improved outcome for the FAS child. Specific recommendations are made for intervention and future research.

%X Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) refers to a pattern of anomalies that include craniofacial, CNS, growth, and various sensory anomalies. We have observed that FAS is associated with four kinds of hearing disorders: (1) developmentally delayed auditory function, (2) sensorineural hearing loss, (3) intermittent conductive hearing loss owing to recurrent serous otitis media, and (4) central hearing loss. As is the case with other syndromes associated with craniofacial anomalies and hearing impairments, speech and language pathologies also are common in FAS patients. Although auditory and vestibular systems arise from similar embryological tissue, vestibular dysfunction is variable in FAS. Early identification and intervention to treat hearing, language, and speech problems should improve the functional level of FAS in children.

%X Among 10 284 data files of neuro-otological patients of our neuro- otological data bank NODEC III, 8,6% pertain to children between 0 and 15 years of age. 350 (3,5%) of these are in the age group of 0-5 years, 261 (2,5%) in the group of 6-10 years and 267 (2,6%) in the group of 11- 15 years. Modern inner ear functional diagnostic methods combine computerised neuro-otological audiometric as well as equilibriometric tests. Ranking of diagnostic applicability and efficiency comprises the following 6 steps of neuro-otological equilibriometric and audiometric tests: Child-adapted psychophysical hearing tests, Perrotatory nystagmus tests via electronystagmography, Postrotatory nystagmus tests via electronystagmography, Acoustic brain-stem evoked potentials ( ABEP ) with 2-channel averager, Caloric vestibular test via electronystagmography, Optokinetic nystagmus test via electronystagmography. It has been proved both clinically and statistically that the perrotatory as well as the postrotatory nystagmus recordings are accepted much better by the preschool children than the caloric test. The latter, however, provides us with superior topodiagnostic information. Acoustically evoked potentials usually require to be performed under sedation in preschool children. Automatic nystagmus evaluation via the computer system NYDIAC immediately yields all the important monocular nystagmus parameters and synoptical test charts, i.e. the butterfly calorigram . The computerbased neuro- otological equilibriometric as well as audiometric investigations should be performed by an experienced and specifically trained otolaryngologist. This diagnostic method promotes intense co-operation with colleagues in paediatrics, ophthalmology, neurology and traumatology.

%X Regular changes in vestibular responsitivity as a function of age are demonstrated with the maximum speed of the slow phase of caloric nystagmus. The clinical implication of this is that, when doing caloric tests, one should not switch for no reason from a once accepted temperature sequence, otherwise comparison with other tests becomes impossible. It rotation tests the best reactions are found in young people. The amplitude is a good parameter to detect age-factors in rotatory nystagmus.

%X Seventeen appropriate-for-gestational-age premature infants (birthweights 1000-1530 gm) were randomly assigned to control (7) and vestibular stimulation (10) groups. Those in the treatment group were exposed daily to three 15-minute sessions of sinusoidal vestibular stimulation over a 2-week period. At the end of that period, postconceptional age ranged from 34 to 37 weeks. As a measure of neurologic maturation, behavioral and physiologic parameters characterizing sleep states were recorded at the onset and termination of the 2-week period. The ratio of active-to-quiet sleep did not change significantly in control patients. Those exposed to vestibular stimulation showed a significant decrease in proportion of active and a concomitant increase in the proportion of quiet sleep. These results may indicate that vestibular stimulation, even at this early postconceptional age, results in a more mature sleep pattern.

Its variability has also been explained by the construction of equiprobable ellipses of tolerance. These ellipses show the part due to growth and the part due to variation, the latter being more pronounced on the level of the dome of the skull than on the level of the basis.

%X Several pedigrees with 19 new cases of the earpits-deafness syndrome (McK +12510) [28] are presented. Mention is made of clinical findings obtained in audiometric and vestibular studies, studies of renal function and configuration and polytomographic studies of the labyrinth, and results of exploratory tympanotomies are discussed. The literature is reviewed and the features found in 138 cases and in our 19 cases are presented. The earpits-deafness syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder in which affected individuals may have sensorineural, conductive or mixed hearing loss, preauricular pits, structural defects of the outer, middle and inner ear, lacrimal duct stenosis, branchial fistulas or cysts of the second branchial arch, and renal anomalies ranging from mild hypoplasia to complete absence. Not all the features of the syndrome are expressed in all carriers of the gene. Pits, branchial clefts and hearing loss are frequently expressed. The incidence of renal malformation is higher, as mentioned earlier in the literature. The poor results of exploratory tympanotomies are discussed. On the basis of personal observations as well as in view of data from the literature it is maintained that the BOR (branchio-oto- renal dysplasia) syndrome [12,30-32] and the BO (branchio-oto dysplasia) syndrome are in fact the same affection. It is also maintained that no separate syndromes can be distinguished on the basis of the type of hearing loss. The present knowledge of the syndrome is summarized in terms of the information available for genetic counselling.

%X Long-term hearing threshold-on-age follow-up data, including non-linear regression analysis, are given for 12 consecutive Pendred patients. The clinical diagnosis of Pendred's syndrome was confirmed by a mutation analysis of the PDS gene in 11 out of the 11 cases tested. Recent imaging of the temporal bones in seven out of these 12 patients showed widened vestibular aqueducts in each case. The diagnostic perchlorate test was negative in one patient, but this test was positive in her affected sister. Mutation analysis of the PDS gene in these patients confirmed that Pendred's syndrome is a monogenetic disorder. Progressive sensorineural hearing loss and widened vestibular aqueducts are characteristic features of Pendred's syndrome, which provides the opportunity to diagnose Pendred's syndrome clinically in the first few years of life, as has recently been suggested in a case report (Cremers et al., Progressive sensorineural hearing loss and a widend vestibular aqueduct in Pendred syndrome, Arch. Otolaryngol. 124 (1998) 501-505). Mutation analysis of the involved gene can be used to confirm the clinical diagnosis.

%X Vestibular evaluation in the pediatric population has in the past taken several forms. For the most part, the pediatric vestibular evaluation has been more subjective than objective. One of the primary reasons for this has been the obvious difficulties encountered in trying to conduct a standard, adult electronystagmography (ENG) procedure on a pediatric patient population not capable of performing in a manner conductive to a good ENG recording. The purpose of this paper is to suggest certain modifications of the standard adult ENG battery for use with young children and infants. Discussion consists of modifications in the areas of various ocular movement tests including sinusoidal pursuit, calibration, optokinetics and gaze testing. In addition, procedures relative to peripheral vestibular output from perrotational and caloric stimulation are discussed. Topics also include the use of a closed-loop caloric irrigator and simultaneous caloric irrigation as viable alternatives to standard, alternative water irrigation when testing the vestibular output of a young child or infant.

The evaluations utilized harmonic acceleration (HA). No age-related maturational differences in HA gain, phase, or symmetry for an 0.08 Hz screening frequency were found when full-term and premature infants were compared. Infrared video technology was adapted to provide continuous visual monitoring of head and eye position in the totally darkened test enclosure.

%X OBJECTIVE: To present new radiological developments using high- resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using heavily T2-weighted sequences at a 1.5 Tesla scanner, maximum- intensity projections (MIP) of the inner ear were generated. The imaging time was less than 20 minutes, and imaging could be performed with adults and children of all age groups alike. This method enables us to visualize and identify the different neural structures of the internal auditory canal. Aplasia or schwannoma of a single or a variation of nerves could be clearly demonstrated. RESULTS: Three- dimensional reconstruction enabled unprecedented clear and precise presentation of the fluid content of the inner ear. The size and shape of 2 to 2 1/2 turns of the cochlea could be routinely demonstrated and analyzed in 45 subjects. Eight patients subsequently received an intracochlear implant electrode, and the intraoperative findings correlated with the imaging. CONCLUSION: The most recent high- resolution MRI techniques provide reliable visualization of submillimeter anatomical structures of the inner ear and auditory nerve.

%X The inner ears obtained from an infant who died of severe congenital cytomegalovirus infection were examined using virological and morphological methods. The techniques of microdissection and surface preparations, immunofluorescent microscopy, and transmission and scanning electron microscopy were employed. Cytomegalovirus was isolated from the perilymph. Injury to the cochlea was minor and was confined to the first half of the basal turn. There were signs of a severe labyrinthitis of the vestibular endolymphatic system. Vestibular organs, especially the saccule and utricle, showed severe damage, with collapse of the saccular membranous wall. Inclusion-bearing cells containing cytomegalovirus antigen, as shown by immunofluorescent staining, and cytomegalovirus virions, as observed by electron microscopy, were found on the endolymphatic surface of the membranous walls, mainly in the saccule and utricle. In the utricle, the infected cells appeared to be concentrated in the regions where the so-called dark cells were located. These dark cells are similar to the proximal tubule cells in the kidney, another common target for cytomegalovirus infection.

%X A descriptive study was conducted to determine types and amounts of stimulation to five sensory systems of an infant that occurred as a result of everyday mother-infant activities. The infant studied was between 4 and 6 weeks of age. Results demonstrated that, overall, the baby received more tactile stimulation than any other type, followed by proprioceptive, auditory, visual, and vestibular stimulation. When activities were compared on a daily basis, feeding was found to provide the greatest amount of stimulation followed by playing, holding/carrying, bathing and changing. When compared on a per minute basis, playing was found to provide more stimulation than any other activity, followed by holding/carrying, bathing, changing, and feeding. The manner in which the various activities were carried out had a strong influence on the types and amounts of stimulation that resulted. Characteristics of both the infant and the mother appeared to be important influences on the types and amounts of stimulation the infant received. It was concluded that both mother and infant should be considered in planning therapeutic programs.

%X This study was undertaken to identify with some precision the location of various paraurethral structures along the length of the urethra. The locations of four areas were identified. The intramural urethra (the area where this structure traverses the bladder wall) extends from the 0 to 15% of total urethral length. The midurethra extends from about 20 to 60% of total urethral length and is the region where one finds the striated urethral sphincter, posterior pubourethral ligaments, and vaginolevator attachments. The urogenital diaphragm with its compressor urethrae and urethrovaginal sphincter is found from 54 to 76% of urethral length. The distal urethra courses from 79 to 100% where the urethra passes between the vestibular bulbs and bulbocavernosus muscles. Some functional considerations of these findings are discussed.

Effects of vestibular, tactile/kinesthetic, auditory, and oral stimulation are discussed with respect to their similarity to the intra- or extra-uterine environment. Long-standing theoretical and methodological problems are discussed, and a "sequential multimodal treatment model" is introduced.

%X There are numerous etiologies of benign vulvo-vaginal tumefactions in children. However, the etiological diagnosis can usually be based on clinical data after careful examination. Para-urethral cysts are the main cause of labial and vestibular tumefactions; they are generally cured by simple puncture. Solid vaginal tumors are uncommon, but they always require surgical resection in order to exclude the exceptional and severe malignant tumours. Neonatal hydrocolpos is frequent in our experience and must always be treated surgically; associated malformations are frequent and must be systematically searched for. Ectopic prolapsed ureterocele and circular prolapse of the urethral mucosa are easily recognizable and need surgical treatment.

%X Internuclear ophthalmoplegia was found by caloric testing of the vestibuloocular reflex in normal, very premature infants, indicating that the medial longitudinal fasciculus is functionally immature. At this age, the medial longitudinal fasciculus is more responsive to stimulation by the oculocephalic (doll's-eye) reflex, which resulted in conjugate deviation of the eyes.

%X Fifteen children with a syndrome called benign paroxysmal vertigo are presented. This syndrome is characterized by attacks of vertigo of sudden onset lasting a few minutes and in extreme cases several hours or even up to 2 days. Additional symptoms are pallor, sweating, vomiting and nystagmus. Consciousness is not impaired. The attacks usually occur in the first 4 years of life. They are recurrent, the appearance varying from several times a week to once a year, and they may cease spontaneously after only months but usually years. The most important differential diagnoses are epilepsy and posterior fossa tumour. The etiology is unknown, but there may be a vascular disturbance affecting the posterior cerebral circulation with secondary disturbances of the vestibular nuclei.

%X Four temporal bones from three previously reported cases showing endolymphatic hydrops and pathology of the vestibular aqueduct (VA) and endolymphatic sac (ES) were investigated further. Pathology of the VA and ES was studied by measuring the sizes of the VA and ES, paying particular attention to the proximal rugose portions. A medial-view graphic reconstruction was created to delineate the course and size of the VA, as well as its correlation with neighboring structures (posterior canal and cochlea). In addition, 20 control temporal bones were selected and measured for quantitative study of the sizes of the VA and ES. The four pathologic temporal bones were shown to have small, simple, tube-like VA and ES, without surrounding bony pathology. This appeared to be congenital hypoplasia characterized by hypoplastic funnel-shaped dilatation of the VA and hypoplastic rugose portion of the ES. Anterior dislocation of the distal portion of the VA and poorly developed periaqueductal air cells were also noted in the pathologic bones.

%X Numerous previous reports have pointed to the importance of movement (vestibular) stimulation in early infancy. Nevertheless, we have currently no clear understanding of these effects. The present paper looks at the role of movement stimulation in the modification of inborn organized patterns of response. Two laboratory experiments are reported in which newborn infants were presented with a cue (movement stimulus) which was either paired with dextrose presentation (experimental group) or not paired (control group). The experimental and control groups differed on the pattern of suckling in extinction, indicating an effect due to the contiguous presentation of movement and dextrose. Those experiments provide an analog for some naturally occurring conditions in early infancy and support some Soviet observations on the development of the earliest conditioned responses.

%X A clinical and genetic study of type 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2) has been carried out in the United Kingdom. Virtually complete ascertainment of cases in the north-west of England was achieved and suggests a population incidence of 1 in 33,000 to 40,000. In the UK as a whole, 150 cases have been identified and been used to study the clinical and genetic features of NF2. The autosomal dominant inheritance of NF2 was confirmed, 49% of cases were assessed as representing new mutations, and the mutation rate was estimated to be 6.5 x 10(-6). Evidence to support a maternal gene effect was found in that age at onset was 18.17 years in 36 maternally inherited cases and 24.5 in 20 paternally inherited cases (p = 0.027). The preponderance of maternally inherited cases was also significant (p = 0.03). Data are presented which suggest that there are two types of NF2, one with later onset and bilateral vestibular schwannomas as the only usual feature, and the other with earlier onset and multiple other tumours. A considerable number of cases did not fall easily into one or other group and other factors such as maternal effect on severity and anticipation need to be considered.

%X Infants (276) were tested with perrotatory and caloric vestibular stimulation at 3-month intervals, from birth till 12 months of age and at 6-month intervals from 12 to 24 months. They were grouped by gestational age and weight at birth. Statistical analyses of the various features of the nystagmus obtained at different ages were performed. Premature and low weight infants were found to have the longest latency and smallest frequency, amplitude and speed of slow component during the first 6 months. As they matured, the latency of response became shorter while the other parameters increased. Complete maturation of responses was attained in all infants within 6 to 12 months of age. Standards for normal vestibular responses in infants up to 24 months of age are set in this study.

%X Nystagmus in response to perotatory stimulation by torsion swing or ice- cold caloric (ICC) irrigation of the ear canals was studied in 276 infants from birth to 12 months of age. The percentage of positive responses to perotatory stimulation correlated with gestational age and weight at birth during the first 3 months of life and became comparable among groups by 6 months of age. The quality of perotatory nystagmus did not differ among groups. A direct correlation between the caloric- induced intensity and duration of nystagmus with gestational age and weight at birth was noted during the first 3 months of life. Premature infants showed the weakest responses, and term-delivered, large for gestational age children the strongest responses. ICC-induced nystagmus reached comparable levels for all groups by 6 months except for premature infants, in whom comparable responses were attainedby 9 months of age. Vestibular responses mature over time, with patterns that correlate with gestational age and weight at birth.

%X Vestibular function studies were performed in 20 children with symptoms suggesting basilar artery migraine. Sixteen children had abnormalities on bithermal caloric testing. Labyrinthine preponderance was found in 1 child with labyrinthine concussion and in 6 children with symptoms suggesting ischemia of the territory supplied by the basilar artery and the occipital branches of the posterior cerebral arteries. Directional preponderance was found in 4 children with symptoms suggesting ischemia of the posterior temporal branches of the posterior cerebral arteries. Five children had both labyrinthine and directional preponderance. normal electronystagmographic findings were present in 4 children and correlated clinically with a milder illness. Head trauma was the triggering factor for the migraine in 5 children. Five children developed complex partial seizures and had evidence of directional preponderance (2 children) and combined labyrinthine and directional preponderance (2 children). The presence of abnormalities on electronystagmography in children with basilar artery migraine correlates with the severity of the disease. Directional preponderance or labyrinthine and directional preponderance are more frequently correlated with ischemia in the posterior temporal branches of the posterior cerebral arteries and may suggest a higher risk of developing vertiginous seizures when ischemia is prolonged.

%X Some infants seem to be born with a degree of respiratory centre immaturity which in combination with other problems such as illness, head colds, exposure to cold, air or smoke, may result in cessation of breathing. Vestibular stimulation by rocking has been shown to be beneficial for premature babies in reducing apnea. There also appear to be other benefits, resulting in more rapid maturation of the nerve cells of the cerebellum which is still developing during the first six months of life. The suggestion is made that crib deaths may be reduced by the use of automatically rocking cribs, particularly during the night when most deaths occur.

Audiometric, vestibular, and psychometric evaluations were performed on gentamicin-treated, kanamycin-treated, and untreated, matched control infants and children. No substantial sensorineural hearing loss or vestibular dysfunction was identified in these patients that could be attributed to aminoglycoside therapy. Performances on the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, Beery Test of Visual Motor Integration, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and on fine and gross motor examinations were comparable for the three study groups.

The cross-sectional area of mucous glands in the vestibular fold, expressed as a percent of the total cross-sectional area of the fold was 19.52 +/- 8.56 (mean +/- SD in the SIDS specimens), and 12.56 +/- 6.25 in the controls. The difference is statistically significant and suggests that excess mucous laryngeal secretion may be present in at least some cases of the syndrome.

%X The gain of the infant vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) was determined when infants were rotated either in total darkness or while they viewed visual targets consisting of a stationary spot or a full field of black and white stripes. The average VOR gain in the dark was 1.03 +/- 0.014 for 1-4-month-old infants and 0.59 +/- 0.03 for adult subjects tested with appropriate controls for psychological "set". Longitudinal studies showed no significant change in gain over the first 4 months of life. Although the presence of the spot or full-field striped background increased adult compensatory gains from 0.59 to 1.0, the same visual targets had no effect on infant gains. Thus, an infant's VOR gain of nearly 1.0 apparently reduces reliance on the poorly developed smooth pursuit and optokinetic systems that, in adults, help the VOR provide perfect ocular stabilization.

%X In chronic schizophrenics, disordered motor development in childhood is followed by more early cognitive and social impairment and poorer outcome; childhood schizophrenics represent the most extreme variants of this. Preschizophrenic infants show a fluctuating dysregulation of maturation--or "pandevelopmental retardation" (PDR)--that involves physical growth; gross motor, visual-motor, and cognitive development; proprioceptive and vestibular responses; muscle tone; and possibly arousal. Pandevelopmental retardation was significantly related to a genetic history for schizophrenia (less than .05), but not to obstetric complications. The severity of PDR was significantly related to the severity of later psychiatric and cognitive disorder (less than .01). Pandevelopmental retardation provides a "marker" in infancy for the inherited neurointegrative defect in schizophrenia. These disordered functions should be studied by anyone interested in the biology of the schizophrenic genotype or in specific early interventions for children at risk.

This is part of a study of evolving neurointegrative disorders that may be associated with a genetic risk for schizophrenia. Transiently decreased vestibular responses coincided with several developmental disorders that were related to psychopathology at 10 years. Absent to decreased responses were associated with (1) a "pandevelopmental retardation" involving physical growth as well as postural-motor and visual-motor development, (2) an "abnormally quiet" state in the first month, and (3) failures of bimanual integration between 4 and 6 months. The transitory nature of the decreased nystagmus rules out the possibility of an organic lesion of the vestibular system. Rather, it suggests that some covert decrease in arousal accompanied those periods when central nervous system integration was disrupted.

%X Laryngeal involvement with candida is usually secondary to pulmonary candidiasis and is seen in patients with impaired immunity. We report a case of isolated laryngeal candidiasis involving the vestibular folds and presenting with stridor in a one-year-old child with Down's syndrome and hypogammaglobulinaemia. Vestibular fold reduction and fluconazole achieved resolution of the disease. Candidiasis should be considered in any potentially immunodeficient child presenting with symptoms of laryngeal disease.

%X Histological study of the temporal bones of an infant with the preauricular pit, cervical fistula, hearing loss syndrome revealed abnormalities in the middle ear, the vestibular system, and the cochlea. There is a gross bilateral abnormality in the form and relationship of the middle ear spaces, the middle cranial fossa and the inner ear. The horizontal canal lacks ampulla and crista; the posterior canal terminates a short distance from the ampulla. The cochlear cavity is approximately four fifths of normal size. The modiolus of the cochlea shows minor abnormalities. Spiral ganglion cells and peripheral nerve fibers are present in all coils, but are below normal in population in the basal and apical coils. The stria vascularis is slightly deformed and partly atrophic in the upper apical coil. An occasional concretion is present in the base of the stria vascularis in the middle and apical coils.

%X Normal young children ranging in age from 1 1/2 to 10 years were assessed in a number of experimental paradigms testing the ability to adapt quickly their strategy of control to altered support surface and visual conditions. The experimental protocols, using a movable platform and visual surround, and the analytic techniques, using EMGs and measures of reaction forces and body motions, were identical to those employed in a complementary study in this issue (Nashner, L. M., F. O. Black, and C. Wall, III (1982) J. Neurosci. 2: 536-544). The structure of automatic postural adjustments in young children was, with the exception of greater variability, similar to that of adult subjects studied previously. However, young children below the age of 7 1/2 years were unable to suppress systematically the influence of inputs derived from the support surface or from vision when these provided inappropriate orientation information due to the motion of these surfaces. The discussion emphasizes that the automatic postural adjustments and the context-dependent reweighting of support surface, vestibular, and visual inputs are organizationally separate processes and that the hierarchically lower level automatic process matures before the higher level adaptive processes.

%X The effects of posture on the visual behavior of 15 3-day-old healthy black newborn males and females were assessed. The amount of time each infant kept his eyes open and the quality of fixation and following a visual stimulus were measured in each of 3 positions: lying down, sitting up, and on shoulder. Although position had little effect on the amount of time the eyes were open, the on-shoulder position significantly increased the quality of the visual behavior. These findings suggest that the vestibular, proprioceptive, and contact stimulation provided by the on-shoulder position affects the newborn's ability to follow and process visual stimuli.

A morphometric analysis revealed that the lateral vestibular nucleus, whose neurons were distinguished from glia after 16 weeks of gestation, divided cytoarchitectonically into the medial and the lateral subnuclei at 21 weeks of gestation onwards, and showed the moderate development in terms of the columnar length and volume, neuronal size and neuropil.

Vestibular Aqueduct/anatomy & histology/*growth & development
%X To investigate a possible developmental relationship between the internal auditory canal (IAC) and the vestibular aqueduct (VA), we made the following measurements in 10 normal temporal bones from individuals 4 months to 70 years of age at death, using a computer-aided three- dimensional reconstruction and measurement method: the volume of the VA, the length of the IAC, and the distance between the IAC and the external aperture of the VA. The degree of periaqueductal pneumatization was also assessed qualitatively by means of a light microscope. The three parameters increased postnatally in parallel with the development of the periaqueductal air cells, and all pairwise comparisons of these parameters showed a statistically significant correlation. Our results indicate that the IAC and VA develop synchronously and in parallel with the development of the periaqueductal air cells. We believe that an understanding of this relationship will be of help during surgery involving the IAC and VA, and may shed some light on the morphological features of Meniere's disease.

%X Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction methods were employed to study the anatomy of the vestibular aqueducts (VAs) in ten postmortem temporal bone specimens obtained from ten individuals aged 4 months to 70 years at death. After reconstruction, the ten 3-D images of VAs were superimposed on one another and differences evaluated. The VA showed postnatal growth and variations in size and shape. However, the variations in angle at which the VA bends near the isthmus were not correlated with age. Furthermore, study of the superimposed images revealed that the 3-D course of the VA was essentially the same in individuals of all ages, despite its wide variability in size and shape. These results indicate that the basic course of the VA is determined before early infancy although the VA grows thereafter, suggesting that VA anomalies such as "large vestibular aqueduct syndrome" (in which the VA takes an abnormally straight and wide course) may be established prenatally.

%X Viral infection has been considered to be a possible pathogenesis of vestibular neuronitis, and reactivation of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) is one of the most likely causes. However, it remains unknown whether the human vestibular ganglia contain latent HSV. We examined 26 vestibular ganglia from autopsied adults in search of HSV type 1 (HSV- 1). To detect HSV-1, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining. HSV DNA was detected in 6 of 10 vestibular ganglia using the PCR method. However, the latency- associated transcript (LAT) of HSV-1 was negative in all of the 16 vestibular ganglia examined. No HSV antigen was detected in any of the ganglia. These results indicate that HSV-1 is latently infected in the human vestibular ganglia, and that LAT is transcribed weakly or not at all.

%X Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) becomes latent in the sensory ganglia after primary infection and VZV DNA has been found in human trigeminal, thoracic, and geniculate ganglia. In this study, human vestibular and spiral ganglia, which do not received innervation from the skin, were examined for VZV DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. VZV DNA was detected in 2 of 10 (20%) vestibular ganglia and in 2 of 10 (20%) spiral ganglia from five adults. VZV DNA was undetectable in either type of ganglion from a newborn and from two of the five adults. These two adults were VZV seronegative. The results indicate that VZV becomes latent in several types of sensory ganglion after primary infection and suggest the possibility that reactivation of the virus from the vestibular and spiral ganglia may cause disorders in the labyrinth.

%X Primary nystagmus was evoked by constant angular acceleration at near- threshold levels (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 degree/s2) in 34 normal human subjects (25 children aged 2-11 years and 9 young adults aged 17-21 years). Acceleration was carried out in complete darkness, and with subjects' eyes open. Analysis of response latencies showed that all subjects responded to acceleration magnitude as low as 0.2 degrees/s2. A decrease in response latency was associated with an increase in acceleration magnitude, and there was no significant effect of age on response latency or its relationship to acceleration. However, a relationship was found between age and the percentage of trials showing the presence of a set of three successive beats during acceleration: a significant increase in the frequency of such trials occurred with increasing age. The relationship of these findings to brainstem vestibular modulatory mechanisms is discussed.

The criteria in the management of the nose and orbicular muscle is analyzed.

Torticollis/*surgery
%X The standard surgical procedures on either peripheral or central nervous system in the treatment of primary spasmodic torticollis are: myotomy, neurotomy, cervical rhizotomy, cortical topectomy, prefrontal lobotomy and a variety of stereotaxic nucleotomies and tractotomies (globus pallidus, thalamus, subthalamus, midbrain). These procedures are briefly reviewed. Some newly proposed operations are than discussed (Svien's labyrinthine suppression and Mazar's interruption of cortico- capsular head-turning pathways). The former surgical intervention is based on physiological and experimental evidence than an altered influence of the reticular substance of the midbrain on the "central" vestibular circuits may be relevant in the genesis of primary spasmodic torticollis. The results are reported of 20 personal cases treated with various surgical procedures with a maximum follow-up of 14.4 years (mean = 6.7 years). It is concluded that at present the most effective and reliable treatment is bilateral anterior rhizotomy of C1-C3 combined with unilateral or bilateral neurotomy (or spinal rhizotomy) of the 11th cranial nerve. The results were rated clinically as useful in 66.6% of the 15 patients treated with this procedure.

%X Four experiments examined the initiation of coordinated head and eye movement and the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Experiment 1 examined the initiation of head and eye movement to stationary, peripheral, visual targets. In adults we would expect to see an eye movement followed by a head movement. The VOR would maintain field-holding while the head rotated. Three-month-olds produced the same pattern of coordinated movement as seen in adults, 2-mth-olds produced only eye movements, i.e., no apparent head movement. Experiment 2 examined the gain of the VOR in darkness in 2- and 3-mth-olds and an adult. The VOR at all ages was qualitatively and quantitatively the same. Experiment 3 examined the gain of the VOR during visual fixation. The gain in 3-mth- olds shoed a significant increase as compared to gain in darkness. The same increment was seen in the adult. Two-month-olds showed no facilitation of gain. Experiment 4 examined tonic suppression of the VOR during visual fixation. While total suppression was seen in adult and the 3-mth-olds, no suppression was apparent in 2-mth-olds. Overall, the data indicate the communication between the visual, vestibular, head movement, and eye movement systems shows a marked shift between the second and third month of life.

%X The influence of the muscular insertions on the mandibular structure in new born infants has been studied with the aid of microradiographical analysis applied to 80 microns thick undecalcified sections and in paraffin sections after decalcification. The left side of the mandibles was cut into sections parallel to the vestibular surface of the bone (fig. 1) and the right side, in frontal sections (fig. 2). The tendinous fibres of the temporal muscle are inserted into the apex of the coronoid process, which is, at this age, constituted by chondroid tissue (fig. 3). The continued differentiation of this tissue within the coronoid process, permits the migration of the temporal muscle insertion. Microradiographical analysis has been used to show the changes of the calcified tissue aspects in the masseter and medial pterygoid muscle insertions (fig. 4 and 5). The insertion of the lateral pterygoid muscle doesn't transform the bone tissue morphology (fig. 6-A and 6-B).

%X 48 healthy neonates born to multiparae were randomly assigned to view a moving stimulus either in the horizontal or the upright position, with or without added vestibular stimulation and with or without pacifier sucking. The infant was shown a moving black line inside a strictly controlled visual environment provided by an apparatus which permitted horizontal and upright positioning and displacement of the infant. Visual tracking was recorded by a concealed TV camera positioned at a constant distance and angle from the infants' eyes in both positions. Quality of tracking during each of 4 trials was scored on a 7-point scale. Results indicate that vestibularproprioceptive stimulation provided to the infant either horizontally or semivertically significantly enhanced his visual tracking, whereas the upright position did not. Pacifier sucking also improved his performace.

To our knowledge no such comprehensive ultrasonic diagnostics in children are reported as yet in the area of larynx. All examinations were performed with a computed sonography system (Acuson 128). We used a linear transducer with a penetration corresponding to 5 MHz an a resolution corresponding to 10 MHz. The frame rate was around 25 Hz and thus enabled a good reproduction of dynamic processes. As we could show, it is possible to visualize all significant structures of the larynx including the thyroid cartilage, the vocal ligament, the vocalis muscle, the arytenoid cartilage and the piriform fossa. Of course the vestibular fold and the cervical musculature are also demonstrable. The high frame rate of the instrument anaibled a good reproduction of dynamic processes. The sonographic demonstration of anatomical structures is possible as well as a functional diagnosis.

%X We report the results of a histopathologic study of 12 temporal bones from seven patients with Down's syndrome and of a dimensional study of the cochlea and the vestibular apparatuses of most of these specimens. Histopathologic study disclosed numerous abnormalities of the middle ear but only a limited number of inner ear abnormalities. The dimensional study showed that, while in the majority of cases the cochlea was shortened, most of the vestibular measurements were within the normal range. We also discuss hearing loss in patients with Down's syndrome and present our hypothesis that remnants of mesenchymal tissue in the round window niche might cause a certain degree of conductive hearing loss in such cases.

%X The clinical entity of delayed endolymphatic hydrops was first defined by Schuknecht in 1978. It constitutes the development of symptoms consistent with endolymphatic hydrops either ipsilateral or contralateral to an ear with a profound hearing loss. We report our experience with this condition amongst 394 patients with Meniere's syndrome followed prospectively. Of 24 patients with the ipsilateral condition, nearly half responded to medical treatment. Thirteen patients underwent vestibular nerve section and the outcome, as assessed by a disability grading system, was very satisfactory. The proportion of patients undergoing vestibular nerve section (54.9%) was substantially higher than patients with classical Meniere's syndrome during the same period (5.4%) reflecting the increased severity of the symptoms. The contralateral form was less frequently seen and patients were more refractory to treatment. The audiological definition of delayed endolymphatic hydrops appears somewhat arbitrary, as these patients form a continuous spectrum with other Meniere's syndrome cases, occurring in association with less marked degrees of sensorineural hearing loss.

%X The purpose of this report is to compare temporal bone computed tomography (CT) to high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using a novel thin-section fast spin echo (FSE) pulse sequence in identifying and characterizing patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome. Sixteen patients with sensorineural hearing loss and a CT diagnosis of large vestibular aqueduct(s) underwent high-resolution fast spin echo magnetic resonance imaging with dual, 3-in phased array receiver coils centered over the external auditory canals. Magnetic resonance imaging parameters included axial and oblique sagittal fast spin echo with an effective slice thickness of 1 mm contiguous. Thirty- eight patients with 76 normal inner ears who underwent MR imaging using this technique had their endolymphatic duct measured. MR alone identified the enlarged endolymphatic sac seen along with the large endolymphatic duct in all cases. Three cases (five inner ears) with enlarged bony vestibular aqueducts on CT showed no evidence of endolymphatic duct or sac enlargement on MR. MR alone identified a single case of mild cochlear anomaly in conjunction with an enlarged endolymphatic duct and sac. In the normal population the size of the normal endolymphatic duct at its midpoint measured from 0.1 to 1.4 mm. Thin-section, high-resolution fast spin echo MR imaging of the inner ear may be superior to CT in the evaluation of patients with the large vestibular aqueduct syndrome.

%X BACKGROUND: Ocular motor apraxia (OMA) in childhood is a poorly understood condition involving a failure of horizontal saccades. OMA is thought to be rare but the literature indicates wide clinical associations. OMA is often identified by abnormal head movements, but failure of reflexive quick phases has been reported in all but a few patients. The extent of this oculomotor disorder was examined in a large group of children with diverse clinical backgrounds. METHODS: The degree of quick phase failure during horizontal vestibular and optokinetic nystagmus was measured using DC electro-oculography and video in 74 affected children, aged 17 days to 14 years. RESULTS: All children showed an intermittent failure of nystagmic quick phases, except for total failure in one case. Other visuomotor abnormalities were common including saccadic hypometria (85%), low gain smooth pursuit (70%), neurological nystagmus (28%), strabismus (22%), and vertical abnormalities (11%). Non-ocular abnormalities were common including infantile hypotonia (61%), motor delay (77%), and speech delay (87%). There was a wide range of clinical associations including agenesis of the corpus callosum, Joubert syndrome, Dandy-Walker malformation, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, vermis hypoplasia, porencephalic cyst, megalocephaly, Krabbe leucodystrophy, Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease, infantile Gaucher disease, GM1 gangliosidosis, infantile Refsum's disease, propionic acidaemia, ataxia telangiectasia, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, vermis astrocytoma, vermis cyst, carotid fibromuscular hypoplasia, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and microphthalmos. Perinatal and postnatal problems were found in 15% including perinatal hypoxia, meningitis, periventricular leucomalacia, athetoid cerebral palsy, perinatal septicaemia and anaemia, herpes encephalitis, and epilepsy. Only 27% were idiopathic. CONCLUSION: Quick phase failure is a constant feature of OMA, whereas abnormal head movements were detected in only about half, depending on the underlying diagnosis. This oculomotor sign is better described as an intermittent saccade failure rather than as a true apraxia. It indicates central nervous system involvement, has wide clinical associations, but it is not a diagnosis.

Treatment Outcome
%X Posterior cranial fossa meningiomas are relatively common extra-axial tumors with important relationships to the cochleovestibular system, facial nerve, and/or cranial base. Nevertheless, objective reporting of auditory and vestibular function is rare for this patient population, and a full discussion of the nonsurgical management is all but totally discounted in the otolaryngology literature. Nine cases (8 operative cases) are presented, with the purpose of correlating neurotologic function with precise anatomic tumor location, available by magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. The usefulness of this information for diagnosis and meaningful scrutiny of the operative results is discussed. A comprehensive review of posterior fossa meningiomas in terms of epidemiology, etiology, and pathology, as well as nonsurgical treatment alternatives, is provided.

No definite vestibular damage could be found in these 37 patients, including three patients in whom greatly elevated serum concentrations of netilmicin had been measured. The present study confirms previous findings in adults showing a low ototoxicity of netilmicin.

%X A series of 227 patients with what are traditionally known as "low" anorectal malformations (ARM) are presented. Perineal fistulas (PF; n = 108), anterior perineal anus (APA; n = 22), and vestibular fistulas (VF; n = 97) represented 73% of the 309 patients with ARM operated on primarily. Diagnosis was based on perineal inspection. In cases of PF and APA, the rectum opens at the perineal skin, anterior to the normal site. Associated malformations were found in 23% of patients with PF and in 13% of patients with APA. Anoplasty without a colostomy was performed in patients with PF. Normal continence was achieved in 93.3%, and constipation occurred in 47%. In patients with APA and intractable constipation, a partial sphincterotomy relieved painful evacuations in 96%. VF is not a low defect; the rectum opens in the vaginal introitus, and dissection of the rectovaginal common wall is necessary for reconstruction. In neonates with VF, the authors performed a sigmoid colostomy followed by a limited posterior sagittal anorectoplasty at 2 months of age. Of the 97 patients with VF, associated malformations were found in 57%. Continence was evaluated in 67 patients with repaired VF. Normal continence was found in 71% and constipation in 50%. Only one patient with VF experienced severe complications and incontinence, after surgical mismanagement. Precise clinical diagnosis and meticulous surgical technique are essential in the management of these benign malformations.

%X Dizziness and imbalance are uncommon in children, but often alarming for their families. A detailed interview and otoneurological examination are important for reaching a specific diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of our study was to obtain our own etiological, clinical and diagnostic statistics, and to review the major related pathologies. We report a series of 76 children with imbalance or dizziness as the presenting symptom. Paroxysmal benign vertigo of childhood was the most common pathology in our study, followed by vestibular neuronitis. Our findings were compared to those of other authors. Early diagnosis is emphasized as the most important factor for achieving an effective vestibular rehabilitation in children.

%X Netilmicin is a new semisynthetic aminoglycoside which was developed by Schering Corporation, USA, for the treatment of serious gram-negative and staphylococcal infections. Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity in animal studies have indicated that netilmicin is both quantitatively and qualitatively safer than other aminoglycosides. Also, netilmicin has a broader spectrum of activity than either gentamicin or tobramycin. 37 clinical studies were conducted by 29 investigators in 10 countries. 840 courses of treatment in 960 infection sites were analyzed for effectiveness. Of the 724 courses in which a clinical determination could be made, 91% had either complete resolution or improvement. Bacteriologic responses were available for 782 infecting organisms and showed an 82% elimination rate. The pharmacokinetic profile of netilmicin permits twice daily administration in most patients with systemic infections and in all patients with urinary tract infections. The clinical safety of netilmicin was measured in 890 evaluable treatment courses, and only 0.4% auditory reactions, 0.6% vestibular reactions, and 0.9% renal reactions were considered to be probably netilmicin related, when netilmicin was given as recommended.

%X This study investigated whether sudden rotation of the support surface (platform) triggers motor responses similar to reactions to sudden free fall in infants at very early age (2 to 5 weeks). Ten infants in prone position were exposed to sudden head-down rotation (mimicking the falling phase) and head-up rotation of the platform (mimicking landing phase) of 4 degrees or 6 degrees amplitude and 35 degrees/s velocity while EMGs and kinematics were recorded from the neck, trunk, and right arm. One infant, reassessed at 13 weeks, and one adult were tested for complementary developmental information. Sudden downward acceleration of the platform, induced either during head-down rotation or during the deceleration phase of head-up rotation, indeed mimicked falling and evoked in infants two-peaked EMG responses in the neck, trunk, and arm muscles, lasting in the latter over several hundred milliseconds. The activation pattern showed similarities to the adult and 13-week-old control subjects. The results suggested that the first burst may be ascribed to cutaneous pressure changes at the body and to vestibular signals triggering a startle-like response, whereas the second burst of the pattern in the arm is likely a candidate for an early substrate of the landing response normally seen during later stages of motor development. Head control appeared to be related more to its position with respect to the orientation of the trunk rather than to space in the infants and in the adult and might be due to the experimental paradigm, in which the surface accelerated away from the body and not, as during normal falling, when the body accelerates toward the support surface.

%X A series of experiments in 2 strains of Wistar rats explored which aspects of maternal separation were responsible for the sleep disturbance of the young. Neither their own mother, after mammary duct ligation, nor constant intragastric infusion of nutrient during the day of separation were found to ameliorate significantly the changes in sleep-wake state organization. However, a periodic nutrient delivery schedule and a formula closely resembling rat milk each ameliorated, and together entirely prevented, the sleep-wake disturbance. Decreased ambient temperature during separation tended to exaggerate the disturbance and periodic tactile-vestibular stimulation tended to reduce it. These findings suggest that the infant rat's normal sleep- wake pattern is maintained by the rhythmicity and composition of the milk delivered to it by its mother, although her warmth and behavioral interaction with it may play subsidiary roles. Separation produces its effects by removing these regulating features of the relationship.

%X In 32 infants with congenital esotropia, I measured the vestibuloocular response. The eight patients with nystagmus compensation syndrome exhibited brisk responses. Fourteen of the 24 who had estropia without nystagmus had severely diminished responses and the other ten had moderate responses. Vestibulo-ocular testing is useful in detecting subtle forms of nystagmus compensation syndrome, especially in young infants, in whom thorough examination of ductions and versions is difficult. Dysfunction of the vestibular system is not necessarily a primary cause of congenital estropia, but brain-stem function in patients with congenital esotropia should be studied further.

The former had spontaneous vertical pendular nystagmus. He also showed horizontal "micronystagmus", present only at the age of 1 year, which might be similar to "voluntary nystagmus". Both males had jerky bilateral gaze- evoked nystagmus, defective smooth pursuit and optokinetic responses and a hyporeactive vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). All three obligate carriers exhibited typical VOR disinhibition in the two horizontal nystagmus directions, which may be a distinctive feature. This feature was also found in one of the 7 possible carriers examined and was not observed in the 3 non-affected males, who had normal oculomotor responses.

%X Three cases of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with long- term audiovestibular sequelae are presented. Case 1 had no hearing in one ear and severe progressive hearing loss in the other ear; he showed vestibular symptoms at the age of 4.5 years. Case 2 had severe but stationary hearing loss in one ear and showed hearing impairment symptoms in the other ear at 9-13 years of age. Case 3 did not have hearing impairment symptoms, or vestibular symptoms, but was found to have severe progressive hearing loss from the age of 15 months onwards, which led to profound deafness at the age of 2 years and vestibular areflexia at or before the age of 4 years. These cases may represent 3 symptomatically different types of delayed endolabyrinthine hydrops. Type 1 (ipsilateral hydrops) incorporates vestibular symptoms only because of a lack of hearing in the offending labyrinth. Type 2 (contralateral hydrops) incorporates hearing impairment symptoms only because of a lack of vestibular function on both sides and type 3 does not incorporate hearing impairment symptoms or vestibular symptoms (other than those relating to a complete lack of function). Given the present findings, those described by Weiss and Ronis (Trans. Pa. Acad. Opthalmol. Otolaryngol., 30 (1977) 52-54) in one case and other reported findings relating to histopathological or imaging methods in somewhat similar cases, it seems appropriate to include congenital CMV infection in the differential diagnosis of delayed endolymphatic hydrops.

%X A comparative study was made on four pairs of temporal bones from patients with Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) and 15 pairs of temporal bones from other infants of the same age range. Spiral reconstructions showed chochlear length to be slightly shorter in temporal bones from patients with Down's syndrome than that in the controls. Based upon these dimensional measurements, a developmental anomaly of the vestibular apparatus was found.

%X Twenty-two surgically treated infratentorial ependymomas were analyzed according to their anatomical origins and characteristics of extension in conjunction with the microsurgical anatomy of the fourth ventricle. The correlation between tumor origin and postoperative survival of the patients was also assessed. The tumors were classified into three types according to their origins and extensions: 1) midfloor-type: tumors originating from the caudal half of the fourth ventricular floor beneath the striae medullares. After occupying the fourth ventricular cavity, they extended downward through the foramen Magendie to the upper cervical level. 2) Lateral type: tumors arising from the vestibular area and/or the lateral recess. They grew not only inferiorly but also laterally to the cerebellomedullary cistern through the cerebellomedullary fissure and the foramen of Luschka. 3) Roof type: tumors originating from the roof of the ventricle. The overall cumulative survival rates at 2, 5, and 10 years were 84, 62, and 47%, respectively. Interestingly, the lateral-type tumors showed a significantly lower 5-year cumulative survival rate and mean survival time (21% and 40 months) when compared with midfloor-type tumors (73% and 170 months). Because the tumor originates near the vital neural structures and because each type has characteristics of extension, a clear knowledge of the microanatomical relationship between the tumor and the surrounding structures would be of great benefit for improving the operative outcome of posterior fossa ependymomas.

%X It is generally accepted from animal studies that the medial vestibulospinal tract originates in the medial vestibular nucleus, which is supplied from the semicircular canals, and descends only to the upper thoracic levels of the cord. In humans, however, there is some indirect evidence to support the concept that impulses from the semicircular canals reach the lumbosacral cord and influence lower as well as upper extremity activity.

%X The present study examined regeneration and restoration of function of the mammalian central vestibular system in the infant rat. The lateral vestibulospinal tract (LVST) of rats was completely transected unilaterally by a ventral approach. After a postoperative interval of one day to three months, the LVST was examined by anterograde transport of wheat-germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and retrograde transport of fluorescent dye. Twelve of the 22 LVST- transected rats showed successful regeneration. The regenerated fibers formed a compact fiber bundle, which sent terminals to their normal targets. The contribution of the regenerated fibers to functional recovery was estimated by analyzing the locomotor capacity of the transected rats. The locomotor movements were measured on the surface of a digitizer table by attaching a miniature resonance coil to the abdomen of the rats. Rats which shows normal locomotor movements represented a marked regeneration of LVST fibers. In contrast, rats with poorly-controlled locomotor movements showed unsuccessful regeneration. These results suggest that, contrary to previous thought, regeneration and functional restoration of the central vestibular system in young rats does occur.

%X Nasal vestibular stenosis is caused by a disruption of the nasal vestibular lining with secondary proliferation of granulation and fibrous tissue. It is most commonly the result of significant nasal trauma of foreign body reaction. In the pediatric population, it is exceedingly rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature. We report the first case, to our knowledge, of complete stenosis caused by traumatic vaginal delivery. This case demonstrates the profound effect nasal vestibular stenosis can have on the developing nose. Correction can be difficult because of the tendency of wound contracture and recurrence. A new approach is presented, using a hard palate mucosal graft. This graft is tough, resilient, and easily harvested. Its ability to resist contracture obviates the need for postoperative stenting, which is especially useful in the pediatric population.

%X Recordings of eye movements from infants and young children can be of clinical value in patients with certain neuro-ophthalmological problems. This requires that the characteristics of normal eye movements in this same age-group are known. Using an electro- oculographic technique in a specially developed laboratory we have been able to assess the saccades, binocular and monocular smooth pursuit, binocular and monocular optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), and sustained vestibular rotation in infants and young children; these recordings were performed in one session lasting approximately 35 minutes. The recordings from four children with abnormal eye movements (delayed visual maturation, hemicerebral cyst, congenital ocular motor apraxia, and gaze-paretic nystagmus) are briefly reported and compared to normal eye movements of age-related children. The limitations of this procedure are discussed.

%X The cerebellar lobules receiving trigeminal afferents, crus 2 and paramedian, and the lingula which receives only vestibular and spinal afferents were studied. Time and the modality of development were compared with earlier experiments carried out on other trigeminal cortico-cerebellar areas. A close connection between quantitative and qualitative aspects of afferents and one type of growth was demonstrated. There was correlation between various morphological features of the cerebellar area and the stages of genesis of masticatory function. Maturity of the certain lobules of the cerebellar cortex corresponded to the onset of weaning. Thus, the development of cerebellar structure seems to run parallel to progressive synergic musculo-mandibular activities associated with certain primary and secondary neuronal tracts.

%X Assumption of the vertical position and independent walking are potentially hazardous motor milestones in the developing infant. It has been presumed that the parachute reactions evolved to protect infants from injury during this developmental stage. To determine the relationship between the appearance of the upper and lower parachute reactions and the developmental milestones of unsupported standing and independent walking, 190 normal infants were prospectively studied. The upper parachute reaction was found to precede the lower by less than a month (mean age of appearance: 8.9 and 9.2 months, respectively). More than one-half of the cohort achieved standing without either the upper (49%) or lower parachute reaction (57%); however, no independent walking occurred without the upper parachute reaction, and only 2 of 190 infants (1%) walked independently without the lower parachute reaction. Onset of walking occurred about 4 months after the appearance of the upper parachute reaction. The significance of these findings is discussed.

%X Twenty-six patients with infantile hydrocephalus were re-examined at ages ranging from 21-32 years. Operations had been performed in 11, but abnormal head growth continued post-operatively in 9. One third of the patients lead a normal life, while half of the patients are mentally deficient. All patients have neurological signs, poor dexterity and clumsiness being present in all. Psychological testing reveals uneven profiles, in 4 patients with performance IQ considerably lower than verbal IQ. Computerised tomography demonstrates all degrees of hydrocephalus with no correlation between ventricular-brain ratio and IQ or between ventricular-brain ratio and operative procedures. Full otoneurological investigation shows differential-caloric examination to be abnormal in 60%, although none of the patients have complaints referring to the vestibular system.

%X BACKGROUND: The majority of girls with imperforate anus are reported to have a malformation of the low variety. Despite this, much of the literature has focused on the more complex, high lesions. METHODS: This study reviews our experience with 44 girls with low imperforate anus from a 22-year period. RESULTS: The incidence of associated anomalies was 61%, which is higher than generally reported. All patients in the study had anal fistulae. Fifty-seven percent had perineal fistulae, 23% had fourchette fistulae, and 20% had vestibular fistulae. Cutback anoplasty was performed in 55%, Potts transfer anoplasty was used in 27%, and 18% of patients were treated with either limited posterior sagittal anorectoplasty or anterior sagittal anorectoplasty. Surgical complications were uncommon. Long-term follow-up was carried out by telephone survey. This showed 89% of the girls to be successfully toilet trained. However, 47% of patients experience at least occasional soilage or episodic fecal incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: Low imperforate anus can be successfully treated using a variety of procedures without colostomy. Most girls with low imperforate anus are successfully toilet trained, but problems with continence persist in a significant number of these patients.

%X Four variations and degrees of severity of the Mondini malformation were found in the temporal bones from two neonates, one with congenital heart disease and the other with trisomy D, and from one teenager with leukemia: 1) short cochlea and normal vestibular organs; 2) short cochlea and persistent horizontal canal anlage; 3) markedly shortened cochlea with no modiolus, wide internal auditory meatus, and persistent horizontal canal anlage; 4) same as variation 3, but with persistent anlagen in all semicircular canals. Variations 3 and 4 were from the case of trisomy D, in which the left cochlea had a normal hair cell population but few nerve fibers, and the intraganglionic spiral bundle was displaced from Rosenthal's canal to the osseous spiral lamina. The right ear had no cochlear nerve fibers; the organ of Corti was present, but hair cells were unusually small. In the case of trisomy D, both ears showed subtotal loss of vestibular nerve fibers. Although the rudimentary cristae of the right ear had numerous hair cells, the macular hair cells were fewer and malformed. No hydrops was present.

Treatment Outcome
%X Feeding and carrying have been interventions used by caregivers throughout history in relieving distress in infants. Recent studies on the food substance sucrose have elucidated the comforting effect of the taste component of feeding while studies of rocking have examined the comforting effect of the vestibular component of carrying. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of sucrose and simulated rocking alone and in combination on diminishing pain response in preterm neonates undergoing routine heelstick procedure in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Preterm infants (n = 85) between 25-34 weeks post-conceptual age (PCA) and 2-10 days postnatal age (PNA) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions for routine heelstick procedure. The conditions were (1) sucrose alone: 0.05 ml of 24% sucrose was placed on the anterior surface of the tongue just prior to the lancing of the heel; (2) simulated rocking alone: 15 min prior to and during the heelstick procedure, the infant was swaddled and put on an oscillating mattress; (3) combination of sucrose and simulated rocking; and (4) placebo: 0.05 ml sterile water administered just prior to heelstick. Physiological (heart rate) and behavioural (facial actions) responses from baseline across 90 s following heelstick were scored second-to-second. Facial actions were analysed with repeated measures MANCOVA and heart rate with repeated measures ANCOVA. Behavioural state and gestational age were covariates. The groups that received sucrose alone or in combination with simulated rocking showed less facial actions indicative of pain than the rocking alone or control group. The addition of rocking to the sucrose condition tended to further blunt the facial expression of pain, but this enhancement did not reach a significant level. Heart rate was not decreased by any intervention compared to the control condition. Although the simulated rocking did promote quiet sleep, which has been reported in earlier studies to blunt pain response, there was no difference between simulated rocking and control groups in either facial expressions indicative of pain or heart rate. The implication of these results is that sucrose, but not simulated rocking may be a means of diminishing pain from minor procedures in preterm infants. Further research is needed on the use of sucrose for more than one procedure as well as examining the contact component of natural rocking, as opposed to simulated rocking.

%X Bilateral congenital atresia presents various problems of hearing, education, psychology and surgery. The complexity of these problems needs a systematic approach, from the initial evaluation to the rehabilitative recommendation. It is very important for infants and children with bilateral aural atresia to be provided with sufficient hearing either through surgical correction of the ear or by a hearing aid or both because bilateral aural atresia gives moderate hearing loss. This paper describes our preoperative assessment of auditory and vestibular function at very early age and the surgical technique for meatoplasty.

%X A light-weight system for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) based on a nasal vestibular cannula and a miniature gas jet has been tried out in 29 newborns with severe idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) and nine infants suffering from respiratory insufficiency caused by lower respiratory tract infections. In infants with IRDS, a permanent effect was achieved in 20% when the birth weight was below 1501 g, and in 74% when the birth weight was higher. The infants with lower respiratory tract infections all recovered without further ventilatory support. Significant complications occurred in only two infants, both of whom developed pneumothorax. The system forms a simple and safe alternative to existing nasal CPAP systems suitable for use in newborns as well as older infants with lung diseases resulting in alveolar collapse.

%X During the eight-year period, 1983-1990, 102 cases of intracranial (IC) and extracranial (EC) complications from 17 144 suppurative otitis media were reviewed. The prevalence of each complication was 0.24 and 0.45 per cent respectively. Facial paralysis, subperiosteal abscess and labyrinthitis were the common complications among the EC group, while meningitis and brain abscess were common in the IC group. Twenty five per cent of the EC group and 44 per cent of the IC group had more than two complications. The reliable warning signs and symptoms for IC complications were fever, headache, earache, vestibular symptoms, meningeal signs and impairment of consciousness. Proteus spp., Pseudomonas aeuruginosa and Staphylococcus spp. were the commonest organisms isolated from both groups. Cholesteatoma and granulation/polyp in the middle ear/mastoid were the major findings in both patient groups. Mortality rate in the IC group was 18.6 per cent. Morbidity rate in each group was 14.3 per cent (EC) and 27.9 per cent (IC) respectively. Epidemiological presentations, clinical features and the result of treatment are discussed.

%X Among 24,321 patients with otitis media treated at the Otolaryngology Department of Chiang Mai University Hospital from 1978 through 1990, 87 patients had 140 central nervous system complications (0.36%). Multiple complications existed simultaneously in almost 45% of the patients. The group developing the complications were mainly in their second decade of life. Meningitis occurred in 43 patients, brain abscess in 29, perisinus abscess in 23, lateral sinus thrombosis in 16, and extradural abscess in 12 patients. The most striking symptoms and signs were increasing otorrhea, visible cholesteatoma and/or granulations, fever, headache and otalgia, and vestibular symptoms. Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcal organisms were found in almost 80% of patients. Overall mortality was 18.4% with brain abscess being the main cause (31%). Epidemiologic presentation, clinical features, and results of treatment for each disease are compared and contrasted to those of previous studies.

A quantitative assessment of vestibular function was made in these children including the habituation response of postrotatory nystagmus. Control groups were included. Both the children with Down's syndrome and the normal children who received vestibular therapy demonstrated positive effects when evaluated using a quantitative motor skills assessment test. Control and treatment children showed vestibular habituation, with treatment children evidencing the greater change. This change may reflect the acquisition of an increased level of central nervous system inhibitory control.

There is photographic evidence of severe damge to the middle and inner ears and to the vestibulocochlear nerve. The middle ear shows evidence of chronic otitis media, a common clinical finding in kwashiorkor. Significantly, the round window membranes in both cases showed thickening and infiltration with inflammatory cells. The inner ear showed the loss of cellular elements and hair cell loss in the spiral organ. A marked decrease of spiral ganglion cells and demyelination of the vestibulocochlear nerve were also seen.

%X The histologic findings in the temporal bones of three patients who died from viral encephalopathy are presented. Pathology was restricted to the scala media, vestibular labyrinth, and internal auditory canal and was considered to be expressions of viral labyrinthitis. The changes were different degrees of degeneration of the organ of Corti, early encapsulation of the tectorial membrane, degeneration of the stria vascularis, and round cell infiltration of the modiolus and contents of the internal auditory canal. A new finding in the organ of Corti and early stages of cystic degeneration of the stria vascularis are documented. In all cases, the saccule was degenerated with sloughing of the otolithic membrane and vestibular labyrinth was involved in varying degrees.

%X GAP-43 is a membrane phosphoprotein whose expression is high in neurons undergoing development or remodeling of axonal connections. This study used a monospecific antibody to GAP-43 to investigate the sequences of fiber tract elongation and synaptic development in the human brainstem. Immunocytochemistry was performed in 14 fetal and infant brainstems; two child and adult cases were also examined for comparison. At midgestation, GAP-43 immunostaining was moderately intense across nuclei and fiber tracts, except for the corticospinal tract, where levels were higher, and cranial nerve nucleus VII, superior olive, inferior colliculus, inferior olivary hilum, inferior cerebellar peduncle, medial lemniscus, and medial longitudinal fasciculus, where staining was nearly absent. By the end of the neonatal period, the relative distribution of GAP-43 immunostaining appeared well- established and similar, although not identical, to that in the child and adult brainstem. Immunostaining was absent or negligible in almost all the cranial nerve somato- and branchiomotor nuclei, auditory-relay nuclei, and vestibular nuclei, while remaining intense in visceral- related nuclei, reticular formation, cochlear nucleus, and periaqueductal gray. Staining was also virtually absent in all fiber tracts at birth, except for the corticospinal tract and central tegmental tract. Persistence of GAP-43 staining in the corticospinal tract past the fetal period suggests that this tract remains in a plastic state beyond initial axonal elongation. Intense immunostaining in visceral-related nuclei into adulthood suggests that these regions may continue to undergo synaptic reorganization. This study provides baseline information relevant to understanding developmental brainstem disorders in early human life.

%X The purpose of this study was to gain basic information about the postnatal development of the vestibular aqueduct (VA) and the endolymphatic sac (ES). For this study, serial horizontal sections of 31 normal temporal bones of individuals whose ages ranged from 0 to 13 years were used. Medial view graphic reconstruction of the VA and rugose portion (RP) of the ES was performed in every case for analysis of the VA and RP. The findings of this study revealed the following new information about the postnatal development of the VA and ES. 1) The VA and RP undergo significant growth postnatally up to age 3 years. 2) In the newborn, individual variations in the VA and RP already exist and at age 3 years significantly wide individual variations which can be classified into three groups (hypoplastic, normoplastic, hyperplastic) may be recognized. 3) Hypoplastic VAs are of two types: one is fairly elongated and tubelike while the other is short and funnel-shaped. The tubelike VA seems to be the prenatal form. 4) The changes that occur with development postnatally in the area of the VA are more closely related to the changes that occur in the length of the external aperture of the VA than they are to the changes that occur in the length of the VA. 5) Development of the area of the VA is closely correlated with development of the area of the RP.

%X Postural control was evaluated in samples of autistic, normal, and mentally retarded children in this pilot study using a recently developed, computerized posturographic procedure. A battery of postural positions was administered including postures involving some degree of "stress" (e.g., occluded vision or standing on pads). The postural patterns of children with autism differed from those observed in normal children, in mentally retarded children, and in adults with vestibular disorders. In comparison to normal children the autistic subjects were less likely to exhibit age-related changes in postural performance and postures were more variable and less stable with more lateral sway. Autistic subjects also exhibited a "paradoxical" response of greater stability with more "stressful" postures, putting excessive weight on one foot, one toe, or one heel. The implications for neuroanatomical models of autism are discussed.

%X Eighty-one healthy, full-term infants were randomly assigned to a control group or one of three experimental conditions: daily administration of a cephalocaudal stroking procedure; placement on a multisensory hammock that provided auditory, vestibular, and tactile stimulation during expected sleep cycles; and a combination of the prior two treatments. All interventions were given during the first 3 months of life. Infants in the control group received the natural stimulation provided in their home environments without additional supplementation. Four- and 8-month assessments were done using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and the Revised Infant Temperament Questionnaire. There were no significant treatment effects on weight or psychomotor development. Although infants receiving unimodal stimulation obtained lower 8-month cognitive development scores than infants in other experimental and control groups, their scores were within normal range. Control group infants achieved the most optimum mood and distractibility scores at both 4 and 8 months.

%X Two types of waterbeds were developed to impart compensatory vestibular- proprioceptive stimulation to premature infants. Twenty-one infants ranging in gestational age from 27 to 34 weeks and birthweights from 1,050 to 1,920 gm were included in this pilot study. Assignment to experimental and control groups was made by random design. The experimental group consisted of ten infants who were placed on a gently oscillating waterbed before the sixth postnatal day, where they remained for seven days. Their clinical progress was compared with that of a control group of 11 similar babies. Waterbed flotation was found to be a safe procedure; there was no significant effects on the infants' vital signs, weight, or frequency of emesis. Highly significant differences were found in the incidence of apnea between the two groups, with infants on the oscillating waterbed having significantly fewer apneic spells. Infants placed on the waterbed during the first four postnatal days benefited more than those placed later. A non-oscillating waterbed was found clinically useful for very small prematures with severe skin problems, for infants recovering from abdominal surgery, and for infants receiving parenteral nutrition.

Vestibular Function Tests
%X This paper reports the results of an intervention study which assessed the effects of compensatory vestibular-proprioceptive stimulation provided by waterbed flotation on the neurobehavioral development of preterm infants. The subjects, who were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups before they were four days old, consisted of infants who were on ventilators for severe RDS. Twenty infants were tested with a new neurobehavioral assessment procedure when they were between 34 and 35 weeks conceptional age. The examiner, a pediatric neurologist, was unaware of the group status of the subjects he examined. The results showed that infants in the experimental group performed significantly better in attending and pursuing animate and inanimate visual and auditory stimuli, demonstrated more mature spontaneous motor behavior, showed significantly fewer signs of irritability and/or hypertonicity and were more than twice as often in th visually alert, inactive state. The assessment procedure, which can be used for longitudinal evaluation of infants ranging between 24 and 36 weeks conceptional age, shows promise of becoming generally useful as a research instrument. Our preliminary results show that the procedure discriminated between an experimental and control group, that inter-observer reliability was readily established and that test-retest reliability is very high in a number of important areas of neurobehavioral functioning.

%X Using data from 179 preterm infants, a neurobehavioral maturity assessment was developed by using a process in which clusters characterized by conceptual coherence and face validity were systematically subjected to statistical analyses designed to test whether they also had high test-retest reliability, statistical cohesion, and developmental validity. The psychometric soundness of the test items was made a precondition for their inclusion into the assessment procedure. Also tested were cluster redundancy, as well as the impact of gestational and conceptional age, and of postbirth influences on the functions tested. 8 dimensions of neurobehavioral functioning were found to be stable with a test-retest reliability of at least .6 or higher on 2 consecutive days, nonredundant and developmentally valid. They were: Active Tone/Motor Vigor, Alertness and Orientation, Excitation Proneness, Inhibition Proneness, Scarf Sign, Popliteal Angle, Maturity of Vestibular Response, and Vigor of Crying.

%X 131 patients suffering from meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae or parainfluenzae were re-examined after 1-15 years, using hospital records, questionnaires, and audiological examination, especially to compare chloramphenicol and ampicillin therapy. Mortality was 3.8%. Subdural effusions occurred in 14.5% of cases uni- or bilaterally. There was deafness in 2.3%, and moderate hearing loss in 8.4%. Convulsions appeared later in 6.9%. The final outcome was good in 60%. The most important factors in prognosis seemed to be the severity of the symptoms and the condition of the patient on admission to hospital. No clear difference was seen between the results of chloramphenicol and ampicillin therapy, but total loss of vestibular function was found in 3 cases in the ampicillin group, and in none in the chloramphenicol group. In mortality and deafness, the differences in outcome were similar, although not statistically significant. As these observations show, the therapy used in Haemophilus influenzae meningitis needs re- evaluation.

%X It is well known that hearing loss is often associated with anomalads, syndromes involving multiple anomalies. The incidence is especially high in severe cases of facial and visceral malformations. However, otologic features remain unclear in patients with a sequence of various anomalies which can not be classified into any known syndrome. We examined 11 temporal bones from 6 patients with severe visceral anomalies, which could not be classified into any known systemic bone diseases, chromosomal abnormalities, or congenital metabolic disorders. Temporal bone pathology was compared with external and visceral anomalies in each case. The temporal bones had been removed at autopsy, fixed in 10% formaldehyde, decalcified and embedded in celloidin. Serial horizontal sections were made at 20 microns and every tenth section was stained with hematoxylin eosin. Most abnormalities in the middle and inner ear were found to have an ectodermal or mesodermal origin. Inner ear abnormalities were noted in 6 temporal bones from 3 patients; the predominant feature was hypoplasia of the semicircular canals. Middle ear abnormalities excluding residual mesenchymal tissue were noted in 5 temporal bones from 4 patients; the predominant feature was an abnormal course of the facial nerve. It was also suspected that auricular and maxillomandibular abnormalities, which are often associated with severe visceral anomalies, indicate a high incidence of disorders affecting the auditory and vestibular systems.

%X A case of congenital urethroanal fistula with a normal anterior urethra in a male child is reported. The fistula was demonstrated between the prostatic urethra and anorectum. This anomaly is usually associated with an atretic anterior urethra and has been variously described as a variant of a urethral duplication by some authors, and of an anorectal malformation (ARM) by others. We conclude that its rightful classification is as a variant of ARM in which the fistula is a result of persistence of the cloacal duct and corresponds to the anorecto- vestibular fistula with a normal anus (perineal canal) in a female.

%X A total of 648 vestibulometric observations of young children suffering from infantile cerebral paralysis revealed diverse vestibular disorders in 85% of the cases. Electronystagmographic findings make it possible to evaluate the functional potentialities of the child's brain in the conditions of cerebral pathology. A certain connection between the vestibular and the motor disturbances is noted. A high sensitivity of the vestibular apparatus to intracranial hypertension in the stage of its clinical compensation is revealed. The vestibulometric findings are used for forecasting the disease outcome and diagnosing disturbances of not only the vestibular, but also of the visual analyzer. The results of the study make it possible to evaluate the sick child's state most completely as early, as in the initial stages of the disease, and to outline the therapeutic strategy.

%X Childhood autism is not usually considered as a neurological disease although frequent antecedents of ante, peri and postnatal injuries are found in its antecedents. Several symptoms of autism particularly in the early development, resemble the signs observed in frontal, temporal, striatal and brainstem dysfunctioning. These cerebral structures are connected with the central dopaminergic system which may be disturbed in autistic children. Such hypotheses suggest the necessary elaboration of an infant and child "behavioral neurology".

%X A tumour of the singular nerve was found on examination of the temporal bones of a child who died 13 months after meningitis. The tumour consisted of a main mass with the appearance of an acoustic neuroma but close by and not connected were some nests of tumour cells inside the vestibule. This very unusual finding raises questions of the aetiology of this tumour which may have a bearing on the aetiology of other tumours of the VIIIth. nerve.

%X BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: A very unusual anorectal defect consisting of a vestibular fistula and absent vagina is presented. Only two previous isolated reports were found in the literature describing a repair that included both abdominal and perineal approach. The authors present another technical alternative that allows the repair via posterior sagittal. METHODS: Of 1,007 patients with anorectal malformations analyzed, eight female cases shared the common anatomic features of a vestibular fistula and absent vagina. What appeared to be the vagina was actually the rectal orifice ending in the vestibule, and the vagina was absent. With the posterior sagittal approach, the distal rectum was used to create the neovagina. The proximal rectum was mobilized and placed within the limits of the sphincter mechanism. Two of the eight patients were born with a patent upper third remnant of the vagina. In one case, the remnant was anastomosed to the neovagina at the time of colostomy closure; in the second one, the anastomosis was performed during the main repair. RESULTS: Four patients are continent of urine and have voluntary bowel movements. One patient is younger than 3 years and therefore has not been evaluated. One patient has a very poor sacrum and therefore is incontinent. One patient had a primary repair elsewhere and therefore is excluded, and another patient is lost to follow-up. One patient is already sexually active. CONCLUSIONS: It is mandatory to perform a meticulous inspection of the perineum in female patients with anorectal malformations to detect unusual defects. Also, a high index of suspicion is necessary to establish the diagnosis of this defect and avoid an inadequate treatment. The posterior sagittal approach represents another alternative to treat these defects without the need for a laparotomy.

%X Mondini's deafness was the congenital malformation of inner ear. We studied 199 ears of 106 cases. Most of them were found deaf when they were babies. High resolution computed tomography of temperal bone was described: cochlea malformation 4 ears; malformation of cochlea, vestibule and semicircular canal 90 ears; vestibular of semicircular malformation without cochlea malformation 105 ears, this type was called the vestibule malformation or untypically Mondini's. Of all the 199 ears there were 81 ears with enlargement of the vestibule aqueducts. The pathogeny, clinical manifestation and treatment were discussed.

%X The histopathologic study of the temporal bones of a case with low-set rudimentary auricles, without preauricular pits or cervical fistula is presented. Abnormalities of the middle and inner ear, fusion of the kidneys, hydrocephalus, short-limbed dwarfism and immunodeficiency are described. An abnormally low position of the middle cranial fossa in relation to the petrous pyramid was observed. The cochlea was of normal length. The modiolus was poorly developed with apparently normal population of ganglion cells and moderate diffuse hydrops of the cochlear duct and saccule. The stria vascularis was partially degenerated in the upper apical coil. Vestibular abnormalities included bilateral absence of common crus of the vertical canals and unusually high origin of endolymphatic aqueduct with no medial dilation present, the convoluted portion of the sac located beneath the dura.

%X In this paper we are reporting a retrospective study of patients under 18 years of age managed at the Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Medical Center from January 1979 through December 1987 with the diagnosis of basilar skull fracture. Sixty-two patients with basilar skull fractures were admitted during that 7 1/2 year period. The most common etiology was pedestrain versus vehicle accidents (42%), followed by falls (27%), vehicle accidents (23%), and being hit by an object (8%). The most common physical findings were hemotympanum (58%) and bleeding in the ear canals (47%). Thirty-four percent of the patients complained of hearing loss. Cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea was noted in 16 patients (26%), while only 1 patient had cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. Facial nerve paralysis was present in 8 patients (13%). Vestibular symptoms were rare. Sixty-three percent of the patients had the diagnosis confirmed by radiography. The clinical presentation, complications, management and outcome of basilar skull fractures in the pediatric population are discussed.

%X Hypoacusia is a common audiologic sequela of hypoxia associated with fetal suffering. Nonetheless, the structural features of the cochlear lesions associated with the disorder have not been studied much. We analyzed histopathologically the cochleas of 21 newborns diagnosed as fetal suffering. Each cochlea was dissected from the temporal bone, decalcified in EDTA, included in methacrylate, sliced into serial 10 microns-thick sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The cochleas of eight newborns were eliminated because of intense autolysis. Of the 13 newborns whose cochlea were considered suitable for histopathologic study, seven had hemorrhage of the vestibular ramp and one had a ruptured Reissner's membrane. The other cochlea was were within the limits of normality. The histologic technique is discussed and the critical factor judged to be the post mortem period prior to sample fixation.

%X Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is an autosomal-dominant condition that causes multiple benign nervous system tumors, especially vestibular schwannoma. Although frequently confused with the more common neurofibromatosis 1, NF2 presents a distinct set of diagnostic, genetic, and management issues. The presentation and natural history of NF2 differs in children and adults, with eighth nerve dysfunction often overshadowed by the effects of other tumors on the nervous system. Molecular diagnostics is an important tool for early recognition of NF2, and when performed in the context of appropriate counseling and follow-up, may lead to a better final outcome of the disease. Further research into the molecular genetic etiology of NF2 promises to broaden the possibilities of therapy for this devastating disorder.

%X Four developmentally delayed babies were given semicircular canal stimulation in an effort to facilitate their motor and reflex development. Each of the children also exhibited abnormal stereotyped movements. The theory was advanced that these movements are related to motor development and that significant improvements in motor abilities will produce changes in the intensity and/or form of stereotypic responding. Semicircular canal stimulation was provided by rotating the children in a motor-driven chair at a velocity of about 17 rpm for 10 minutes daily over a period of 2 weeks. Standard motor and reflex measures were taken before, during, and after the rotation treatment period. Daily observations were made of the children's stereotyped movements. Over the course of the study all of the children showed motor and/or reflex changes that were attributable to the vestibular stimulation. In addition, some evidence was obtained linking changes in stereotypic responding to the vestibular stimulation.

%X The ears of 47 selected patients with congenital sensorineural hearing loss were examined with complex-motion tomography. The patients were divided into 3 general categories: those with a recognized syndrome, those with sensorineural hearing loss unrelated to any known syndrome, and those with microtia. A great variety of inner ear anomalies was detected, but rarely were these characteristic of a particular clinical entity. The most common finding was the Mondini malformation or one of its variants. Isolated dysplasia of the internal auditory canal or the vestibular aqueduct may be responsible for sensorineural hearing loss in some patients. Patients with microtia may also have severe inner ear abnormalities despite the fact that the outer and inner ears develop embryologically from completely separate systems.

%X Age- and pathology-related changes in the relative contributions of visual and somatosensory inputs to dynamic balance control were evaluated. Young adults (mean age = 25, SD = 4) were compared to older adults (mean age = 68, SD = 5). Electromyographic responses were collected when subjects' balance was perturbed on a movable platform. The amounts of visual information and of somatosensory input at the ankle were manipulated. Muscle response latencies, losses of balance, and muscle sequencing were analyzed. Muscle response latencies did not differ across age groups. Loss of balance data indicated that older adults were less stable under conditions in which peripheral vision was occluded and ankle somatosensation was limited (only foveal vision and vestibular input remaining). Older adults showed more antagonist muscle activation and used muscle sequences not seen in young adults (e.g., hip strategy). These effects were exaggerated among subjects in whom borderline pathology had been diagnosed.

Nine had orodigitofacial (ODF) I syndrome (Papillon-Leage, 1954) and two had ODF II syndrome (Mohr, 1941). The authors observed seven median clefts of the upper lip, eight atypical cleft palates, nine lingual tumors, ten polylobed tongues, four ankyloglossia. All vestibular frenula were hypertrophied. Facial analysis showed five facial hypertelorisms, eight epicanthal folds, ten anomalies of the forehead. Nasal anomalies were constant with ten alar hypoplasia and four nasal curves. Syndactyly was the most frequent anomaly of the hand. Seven patients were mentally retarded. Transmission of ODF I is by X-linked dominant variable expression; ODF II is autosomal recessive. The difference in transmission means a precise diagnosis is necessary. Bilateral duplication of the great toe is characteristic of type II, but not pathognomonic. Hair and cutaneous anomalies suggest type I. The authors proposed a surgical treatment involving three operating steps.

%X BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance which leads to tumor growth in the central and peripheral nervous system. In affected adult patients there is a typical association with ocular abnormalities like juvenile cataract. METHODS: Ophthalmologic investigation was carried out in ten children aged one to fourteen years with suspected NF2. The diagnosis was confirmed by further clinical examination and-in one patient-by segregation analysis. RESULTS: Nine of these ten children showed ocular abnormalities such as juvenile subcapsular cataracts, retinal hamartomas, optic nerve sheath tumors, fibrotic maculopathies as well as one case of a perineural calcification of the optic nerve and one case of a cerebral hamartoma on the ground of the third ventricle. DISCUSSION: In six children ophthalmological symptoms were the presenting symptom of the disease. The knowledge of these symptoms allows for the diagnosis of NF2 in children who present with isolated ocular deficits or with other typical criteria of the disease. The early diagnosis of the disease may lead to an improved prognosis with regard to preservation of hearing by surgery of bilateral vestibular schwannoma which occur in more than 90% of the NF2-patients.

%X Based on the proportion of resistant, moderately sensitive, and sensitive strains, the descending order of activity of amikacin against clinical isolates of urinary pathogens was Salmonella, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter, Proteus species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, amikacin was the most active of the antibiotics tested (including gentamicin and tobramycin) against 100 strains of P. aeruginosa. The calculated half- life of amikacin was substantially longer in patients with compromised renal function than in normal subjects. Immaturity of renal function, characteristic of the newborn, similarly slowed the rate of excretion of amikacin. The cure rate (complete clinical remission and eradication of the pathogen) was 91% in 22 patients with urinary tract infection (including 16 with chronic pyelonephritis) treated with 500 mg of amikacin every 8 or 12 hr for eight to 17 days. After single injections of 7.5 mg/kg 2-3 hr before delivery, appreciable amounts of the drug were recovered from the cord blood. No local or systemic intolerance or laboratory abnormalities were observed in a total of 42 patients (including eight infants) treated for a maximum of two weeks. No ototoxicity was demonstrable in any of the 12 patients subjected to audiometry; nystagmography revealed slight vestibular dysfunction in two elderly patients.

%X Secondary nystagmus is frequently seen following cessation of prolonged unidirectional vestibular stimulation. It is explained on the basis of an adaptation during the application of the stimulus which leads to an apparent stimulus in the opposite direction when the stimulus is removed. The same phenomenon would be expected with vestibular disease when after a period of adaptation to the vestibular asymmetry, the affected ear recovers some or all of its function. The seondary nystagmus in this instance beats toward the affected ear and has been termed recovery nystagmus because it is generated by recovery of function. Two cases with recovery nystagmus following acute attacks of vertigo are presented.

%X Deafness due to inner ear anomalies is rarely associated with malformations of the auricles. We describe two brothers with profound congenital sensorineural deafness, abnormal vestibular function, normal ossicles, and delayed motor development. Since the external and inner ear originate from distinctly separate structures, the embryogenesis of this malformation association is less clear than in the more common association of external and middle anomalies, where the latter two structures are derived from the first and second branchial arches. The combination of auricular and inner ear anomalies, with sparing of the middle ear structures, can be explained on the assumption that mesodermal induction is responsible for normal differentiation of both the otocyst and of the branchial arch ectoderm. A recessive mutant gene may lead to a deficiency of a mesodermal inducer substance of a target tissue receptor site. A similar mechanism may be involved in other multiple malformation syndromes, whereby a mutant gene acting during a specific period of organogenesis causes disruption of the normal induction-competence relationship.

%X It is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. Previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. This study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. Our study revealed the following: (a) Suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. Of these 20 bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. Eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. This staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. Its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) Sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. This finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing SNHL by therapeutic intervention. Spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing loss in addition to the cochlea. This subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) It has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent SNHL is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible SNHL is caused by serous labyrinthitis. Our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) The data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) There were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. A notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.

%X Traditional evaluation of strabismus has included cover test measurements, evaluation of the range of ocular rotations, and an array of subjective sensory tests. These studies could not always differentiate paresis of an extraocular muscle from restrictions and from various neuro-ophthalmic motility disorders. The measurement of horizontal and vertical saccadic movements can provide an objective test of rectus muscle function. Using EOG, saccades can be recorded easily, inexpensively, and repeatably at any age. In ocular muscle paresis or paralysis, saccadic speed is reduced mildly to markedly and can be used to monitor recovery. Assessment of saccadic velocity does not appear useful in evaluating superior oblique palsy, although it is valuable in sixth nerve palsy, Duane's syndrome, and third nerve palsy. When restrictions are the major cause of limited rotation, as in thyroid ophthalmopathy and orbital floor fracture, saccadic speed is unaffected. The induction of OKN or vestibular nystagmus is helpful in the study of children too young to perform voluntary saccadic movements. In patients with limitation of elevation or depression, this technique can separate innervational from mechanical causes of diminished rotation. The specific saccadic velocity pattern in myasthenia gravis, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and Mobius' syndrome is helpful in differentiating these disorders from other neuroophthalmic motility problems. Transposition surgery of the rectus muscle is effective because of an increase in force, seen as an improvement in saccadic velocity and resulting from the change of insertion of the muscles. Saccadic velocities can also be of assistance in diagnosing a lost or disinserted muscle following surgery for strabismus. Although analysis of saccadic velocity is not required for the proper evaluation of all problems in strabismus and motility, it can be of inestimable value in the diagnosis of many complex and confusing disorders. Together with forced duction testing, a clinical profile can be obtained concerning muscle force and muscle and orbital restrictions, which are required information for appropriate surgical planning.

%X Babies usually cry almost two hours a day, and about 15 per cent of them cry for more than three hours a day. Excessive crying is most common during the first three to four months of life, after which the frequency of crying decreases. For some parents their baby's crying is a problem, while other consider it a normal phenomenon and do not become irritated. Parental tolerance of infant crying is dependent not only on its frequency or intensity, but also on the psychological characteristics of the parents, and the amount of information, household help and social support that is available to them. Crying during the first few months of life is usually attributed to "colic", even if it is not known whether the infant suffers from gastrointestinal disturbance. The recommended treatments for excessive crying include medication, vocal, vestibular or tactile stimulation, hospital admission, and changes in parent-infant interaction.

%X Mumps is thought to be the most common cause of unilateral acquired sensorineural deafness in children. Mumps deafness is usually sudden in onset, profound or complete, and may be associated with vestibular symptoms. The authors' clinical survey of 55 patients with unilateral deafness which could reasonably be ascribed to mumps indicates that the hearing loss is exclusively unilateral, severe or total and permanent, and that approximately 45% of the patients experienced dysequilibrium of vestibular origin. An analysis of the present series of mumps deafness also suggests that the primary route of invasion of the virus is hematogenous, and thus the term "viral endolymphatic labyrinthitis" is proposed as the possible pathogenesis of the deafness, since both tympanogenic and meningogenic routes of viral invasion to the labyrinth can be excluded on the basis of the clinical and cerebrospinal fluid studies. This view of the pathogenesis, particularly that mumps meningitis is not associated with deafness, is supported by several reports including those of Vuori et al. (1962), Azimi et al., (1969), Lindsay (1973), Nadol (1978), etc. The incidence of deafness following mumps appears to be extremely low, approximately 1:20,000, as estimated by Everberg (1957).

%X The histopathologic findings in five temporal bones from three patients with congenital malformation of the inner ear are described. The external contour of the cochlea was deformed in two temporal bones, while the internal architecture was abnormal in all five temporal bones. Intracochlear abnormalities included defects in the interscalar septum, deficiencies in the modiolus, and a paucity of neural elements. Spiral ganglion cell populations varied, but were substantially diminished in all five temporal bones. Enlargement of the vestibule and semicircular canals (lateral and posterior) was seen in two temporal bones. A large vestibular aqueduct and saccular hydrops were found in one temporal bone each. An attempt was made to relate the histologic patterns of deformity to the proposed clinical classification of inner ear malformations. Radiographic abnormality of the cochlea would have been detectable in two bones (incomplete partition pattern), while two other bones would have appeared as vestibule-semicircular canal syndromes. One bone would have been radiographically normal.

*Vertigo/diagnosis/etiology/therapy
%X The main difference between childhood and adulthood vertigo is that the evaluation of symptoms and examination pose special challenges in pediatric patients, depending on age. Vertigo in pre-teenage children is similar to vertigo in adults. In contrast, although benign paroxysmal vertigo, vestibular neuronitis, and Meniere's vertigo occur in children, the distribution of these conditions is different from that seen in adults. After vestibular and cochlear investigations as well as a CT scan or MRI study to outrule a tumor of the posterior cerebral fossa, the diagnosis of vestibular vertigo is established. Often, the diagnosis proposed cannot be considered as final and requires reappraisal according to the long-term course. Collation of case-reports with highly accurate documents is essential in order to strive to develop more satisfactory approaches.

%X Sixty children who survived meningitis during the outbreak of meningococcal group B infection in Bolton 1971-74 were assessed between 5 and 9 years later. Each case, together with a matched control, has been examined clinically and subjected to a number of psychological tests and to routine audiology. The results, unlike those from other series, did not demonstrate any incoordination, ataxia, or other physical abnormality, nor was there any statistically significant impairment on psychological testing. The incidence of sensorineural deafness (5%), although marginally lower, was comparable with the best of other series. When compared with the incidence in controls (3%) it is not statistically significant. A 'mattress test', suggestive of vestibular damage, was positive in those with more severe degrees of sensorineural deafness. The high mortality in the Bolton series (17%) has been reconsidered and it is concluded that unless a potent meningococcus type B vaccine is developed, mortality would still be high in a similar outbreak today.

%X Of 99 consecutive patients with meningococcal disease, 6 died during the acute stage. The 93 survivors were examined one year after hospitalization. 21 (40%) of the adults and 6 (15%) of the children had definite sequelae, and an additional 27% and 11% possible sequelae. 6 adults (12%) and 1 child (2%) had definite neurological sequelae. Electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities were observed in 7 adults (14%) and 2 children (5%). Epileptogenic activity was present in 3 of these, but none had experienced seizures. 8 adults (19%) and 5 children (14%) had sensorineural hearing loss or impaired vestibular function. Cerebral computerized tomography (CT) scan showed definite and possible abnormalities in 1 (3%) and 6 (18%), respectively, of the 34 patients tested. Neuropsychological tests were performed in 9 patients, 2 of these showed definite impairment. The frequency of neurological abnormalities was higher than in many previous studies, probably reflecting the more comprehensive examinations performed in the present study. However, only 3 patients had serious sequelae. The results suggest that the occurrence of sequelae after meningococcal disease is related to the severity of the acute disease. This may explain the higher rate of sequelae in adults, who have a higher proportion of seriously ill patients. The presence of meningitis is not required for the occurrence of neurological sequelae.

Thirty-eight articles containing case histories of 45 patients with spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid middle ear effusion reported in the English literature from 1913 to 1983 were reviewed. Four additional personal cases, representing the largest single series, are described in detail. Classification of these cases into the following three types has been possible: (type I, abnormal connections through the otic capsule; type II, abnormal connections adjacent to the otic capsule; and type III, abnormal connections distant from the otic capsule. The diagnostic and therapeutic implications of each type are unique. Age, auditory and vestibular test results, and computerized or hypocycloidal tomography differentiate the three.

%X Peripheral vestibular equilibrium disorders may originate in various parts of the labyrinth or the vestibular nerve. Traditionally, the function of the lateral semicircular canals has been assessed with caloric irrigation, and sometimes falsely been interpreted as a vestibular nerve lesion. The vertical semicircular canals are not easily assessed. Caloric testing with the head in different positions is not very helpful, but the canals may pairwise be tested using specific rotational techniques. Often the otolithic organs, capable of detecting linear acceleration forces, are forgotten as a source of vertigo and dizziness. We have implemented horizontal rotatory testing with the subject seated eccentrically facing the direction of rotation as a means of assessing otolithic function. The subject experiences a lateral tilt and is instructed in darkness to put a short light bar in the position he thinks a water surface would have, which is identical to his perceived tilt. In 39 normal subjects, a theoretical tilt of 24 degrees was estimated as approximately 19.5 degrees, and the standard deviation was 6 degrees. A side difference index was proposed to be normal if below 25%. The preliminary findings in a few patients with known labyrinthine lesions are presented. We propose that otolithic as well as lateral semicircular canal functions are useful to monitor in patients with suspected peripheral equilibrium disorders.

%X We report two cases of herniation of the singular nerve into the round window niche and one case of bony dehiscence without herniation between the round window niche and the posterior canal ampulla. It is believed that the middle ear and the inner ear are completely separate. However, in the temporal bone of a 10- to 15-week-old human fetus, a communication between the round window niche and the posterior canal ampulla is observed. Later, the mesenchymal tissue in the communication is replaced by cartilage from near the posterior canal ampulla. If the communication does not fill with cartilage, ossification is not able to begin behind the posterior canal crista. When there is bony dehiscence behind the crista, the singular nerve fibers are easily pressed out by ossified endosteal bone and herniated into the round window niche.

Predictive Value of Tests
%X Clinical assessment is an essential fundamental element in the evaluation of comatose states, particularly in children. Paediatricians quickly recognized that the early Glasgow Coma Scale, used for over 20 years in adults, is inadapted for children because it lacks brain stem criteria, involves interpretation of motor response (particularly difficult in infants) and uses verbal response which is of little value before language acquisition. The first attempt at standardized coma assessment in children was the Paediatric Coma Scale, developed in Australia in 1982. This scale improved on the Glasgow scale, removing the motor retraction response, modifying the verbal response scale (normal, words, sounds, crying, or none) and quantifying the best possible score as a function of age. In 1983 a fundamental modification was proposed in the Jacob scale. Besides removing the motor retraction response, this scale replaced the verbal scale with one based on ocular behaviour, thus evaluating consciousness of presence or stimulation. The vestibular response and pupil reactions were also included to assess brain stem activity. In 1987, we introduced the Bicetre scale which uses ocular behaviour instead of verbal response and separates ocular diameter as a specific criteria. Assessment of four reflexes (mimic, photomotor, cornea and cough) provides precise information on the activities of the different levels of the brain stem. Several comparative studies have been conducted to determine the positive predictive value and interpersonal variability of these scales. In a prospective multicentric study of 277 comatose children aged 6 months to 15 years, we found that the Bicetre scale had a positive predictive value of 94% for good outcome at 24 hours and that interpersonal disagreement occurred in only 10.1% of 65 cases studied (compared with 13.5% for the Glasgow scale which was studied simultaneously). Paediatricians now have reliable clinical scales for assessing the conscious level in children.

%X The displacements, durations, and velocities of the slow and fast components of both the primary and secondary nystagmus induced by constant angular acceleration were measured in 46 normal children 1 month to 11 years old. There were significant changes in nystagmus parameters in respect to maturation. The young infant had larger amplitude, higher velocity beats than the older child during both the primary and the secondary nystagmus. Parameters describing both the primary and the secondary nystagmus reached their peak values and terminated earlier in the infant than in the older child. Although the slow component velocity during secondary nystagmus was much slower than during the primary nystagmus at all ages, the secondary nystagmus/primary nystagmus ratio was significantly greater in early infancy. Thus, in infancy, as compared with later childhood, the vigor of the secondary nystagmus was disproportionately greater than the primary nystagmus. These results were discussed in relation to the maturation both of vestibular responsiveness and of vestibular adaptation.

%X Responses to vestibular stimulation can, under well-controlled experimental conditions, provide a measure of brain-stem function. Autistic children had significantly longer time constants during the primary nystagmus response and significantly fewer beats during the secondary response than normal children when stimulated with constant angular acceleration in complete darkness. These findings could not be attributed to gross differences in arousal, to developmental retardation, to associated clinical conditions, or to either the influence of vision or habituation. Rather, they are suggestive of a neurophysiologic dysfunction, perhaps involving the brain stem, and may be an expression of the process that underlies those autistic behaviors that suggest faulty modulation of sensory input and motor output. Brain- stem centers modulate both general sensory input and motor excitation and may play a role in the elaboration of the more complex adaptive and motivated behaviors that are also disturbed in autism.

%X Two hundred and ninety cases of congenital anorectal anomalies were collected in a survey of the experience contributed by belgian surgeons over the last ten years (1971-1980). The incidence (1 in every 4,500 live births) and the sex ratio (56% males, 44% females) are similar to accepted figures in white race; this suggests that most of the cases have been included in the survey. The collected series was analysed according to the international classification proposed in 1970. It differs from most reported series 1 degrees in boys by the prevalence (58%) of low, infralevator types and the unusually high frequency of recto-vesical fistulas (versus recto-urethral); 2 degrees in girls, by the very high prevalence (80%) of low types and a relatively heavy incidence of low recto-vaginal fistulas (versus recto-vestibular). These characteristics could be partly related to a lack of accuracy in the diagnostic work-up. Every new case of anorectal anomaly should be accurately described and classified since the choice of surgical approach and the functional result are related to a large extent to the type and the level of the malformation. Use of the international classification is recommended.

%X The application of recently developed, quantitative literature reviewing methods (meta-analysis), detailed in the companion article in this issue, is illustrated by examining the results of studies that explored the effectiveness of vestibular stimulation as a form of sensory stimulation. Sixty-seven studies were located that employed some form of vestibular stimulation as the independent variable. Fourteen of these studies met criteria consistent with traditionally accepted standards of empirical inquiry in the behavioral and biomedical sciences and were included in the review. The 14 studies contained 31 hypothesis tests that evaluated the efficacy of vestibular stimulation as a form of sensory enrichment designed to facilitate various developmental parameters. An analysis of the results of these tests, using quantitative reviewing methods, revealed that subjects receiving vestibular stimulation performed significantly better than members of control or comparison groups who did not receive such stimulation. We can begin to answer questions of efficacy using research reports which currently exist when that research is properly synthesized by the quantitative review method. The use of quantitative reviewing procedures is recommended to help establish a consensus when synthesizing conflicting research literature in the behavioral and biomedical sciences.

%X Five temporal bones were serially sectioned and studied concerning spread of erythrocytes and blood-derived precipitate in patients who died from subarachnoid hemorrhage. Erythrocytes followed the natural pathways--the cochlear aqueduct, the cochlear, vestibular, facial and glossopharyngeal nerves, and were demonstrable in the inner ear fluid spaces. The temporal bone marrow spaces were also filled with erythrocytes, particularly in the hypotympanal area. In the microimmunoelectrophoresis, no specific precipitation lines formed between the anti-CSF serum from rabbits and middle ear exudate from human ears with acute otitis media. Although, in animals, middle ear spaces have been shown to be connected to the middle ear space this does not seem to apply to human ears, and CSF fluid components are not involved in the formation of middle ear exudate.

%X From a histopathological survey of 12 ears (7 cases) of Mondini's deformity and deafness, the following conclusions or interpretations are drawn: 1) Mondini's bony deformity diagnosable by polytomography does not necessarily indicate Mondini's deafness or x-ray diagnosis of Mondini's deafness cannot be specifically relied upon. 2) The pars superior (semicircular canals and utricle) may be absent (aplastic) or the canals may be enlarged leading to interesting questions regarding vestibular physiology in such patients. 3) Enlarged endolymphatic duct and deficient utriculoendolymphatic valve are commonly found associated with absence of endolymphatic hydrops or collapse suggesting an operational longitudinal flow. 4) One and one-half or fewer (instead of 2 1/2) cochlear turns are characteristic; however, end-organ of Corti lesions (aplasia) may be present or absent leading to interesting speculations for further research regarding auditory function, especially in those cases with normal-appearing sensory structures. 5) Mechanisms of hearing loss in Mondini's deafness can be variably explained on the basis of inner ear or middle ear pathology including dysgenesis of the end-organs and associated neural elements sufficient to cause sensorineural hearing loss, aplasia of the oval or round windows which might explain manifest "sensorineural hearing loss" in the presence of normal-appearing organs of Corti and aplasia or infection of the middle ear causing a conductive loss which can be superimposed upon a sensorineural hearing loss.

%X This paper strengthens the importance of neonatal screening in the early identification and etiological specification of hearing loss by demonstrating that subclinical cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common viral agent causing sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) among pediatric patients. Consequently, if hearing impairment is found on neonatal screening, viral studies should be done at once. In addition to a survey of previous literature, these points are presented from a retrospective study of 14 children with SNHL caused by focal CMV. Moreover, vestibular studies are presented which suggest that hearing and vestibular impairments may operate independently of one another or conjointly in patients infected with CMV.

%X A review of the literature gives considerable evidence that there are manifestations of migraine involving the vestibular system starting in infancy and proceeding to late life. This paper deals with these manifestations in the first two decades of life. There is evidence that vestibular symptoms are probably caused by involvement at different levels of the system in different cases. Paroxysmal vestibular symptoms may occur in association with headache, temporally independent of headache, or without headache, and may at times be the chief complaint causing the patient to seek help from the otolaryngologist in the latter two instances. Other neurologic symptoms may or may not be present. Meticulous family, past personal, and present history are the sources of information necessary to suspect the association of paroxysmal vestibular symptoms and a migraine diathesis. A prospective study of a large neurotologic population of this age group with recurrent paroxysmal vestibular symptoms seems indicated and may lead to diagnostic and therapeutic benefits.

%X Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that even short-term separation of preweanling rat pups from the mother produces adverse effects in the pup. These include alterations in ornithine decarboxylase activity and in the secretion of growth hormone and corticosterone. The present study demonstrates that while intermittent heavy stroking effectively reverses or prevents all the changes associated with maternal deprivation neither kinesthetic nor vestibular stimulation affects these responses. The results verify earlier findings from this laboratory indicating that tactile interactions between rat pups and their mother modulate pup physiology and provide experimental support for the hypothesized role of tactile stimuli on early infant development.

%X Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is a clinical disorder that usually begins at age 4. The child's otoneurological examination is normal in the intercrisis and the brief episodes of true vertigo are typical. In this paper we describe six new cases that had a follow-up of at least one year after diagnosis. Only a few of the patients had demonstrated vasomotor migraine, but all the children had a family history of migraine, which supports the hypothesis that this disorder is a migraine equivalent. The pathogenesis may be related with a transitory vascular disturbance that produces ischemia of the vestibular nuclei and pathways, as occurs in other vascular territories during typical migraine. One longer-than-usual episode is reported. Otherwise, the evolution of this condition is favorable.

%X In 56 full-tem A.G.A. infants and in 27 infants of a minimal age of 15 days with a neurological "risk" (full-term small for gestational age, S.G.A.), the nystagmic response to vestibular stimulation (rotatory and torsion swing test) was examined. A delay in the appearance of a response to the labyrinthic stimulus and a persistence of the prevalence of the slow phase of the nystagmus appeared clearly higher in the "risk" infants. The statistical difference of the response between the two groups was highly significant. This allowed us to conclude that the vestibular test appears to the one of the most useful in evaluating the sensorial maturation of S.G.A. infants.

%X This work reports on the hearing loss of 395 patients who were hospitalized after brain concussion. The percentage of hearing loss and vestibular disturbances appearing after fracture of the temporal bone is higher than in cases with skull fractures without fracture of the temporal bone or with brain concussion alone. Conductive deafness caused by head injury usually disappears in two months time. If conductive deafness remains, the suspicion of dislocation of the ossicular bones arises and such patients must undergo an operation. As the cases where sensorineural deafness disappeared within six months after head injury were rare, final evaluation of the hearing loss can be made one year after the head injury. In the majority of cases, vestibular disturbances and positional nystagmus disappear within six months after the head injury.

%X The prolonged labyrinthine stimulation produced by the conventional caloric irrigation is uncomfortable and fatiguing to patients and necessitates an undesirable waiting period between applications of the test. The present report describes the use of a short-acting caloric test, and an analysis of all available data on 100 consecutive patients evaluated with this procedure. Because the labyrinthine stimulus produced by the new method is short-acting and because the stimulus was applied at reduced intensity in patients who were more sensitive, the new procedure was well tolerated even when five or more irrigations were used. It was found convenient to repeat irrigations when results were uncertain, thereby ensuring a more reliable assessment of vestibular function.

%X Two cases of congenital unilateral deafness in otherwise normal children are presented. X-ray examination showed a partition of the inner ear canal in one of them. A review of the literature showed this lesion to be very rare, but it is more frequent in combination with other malformations such as the Klippel-Feil-syndrome, Wildervanck- syndrome and Thalidomide embryopathy. The second child showed an extensive malformation of the cochlear and vestibular parts of the inner ear and of the internal auditory meatus. The vestibulocochlear nerve was absent. An arachnoidal cyst protruding into the tympanic cavity formed the only boundary between the middle ear and the cerebrospinal fluid. This resulted in relapsing meningitis and a postmeningitic hearing loss on the other side. A tympanoscopy and closure of the connection between the tympanic cavity and the internal auditory meatus stopped the ascending infections.

%X OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the hearing changes in the long term after vestibular neurectomy, endolymphatic mastoid shunt, and medical treatment in classic Meniere's disease. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case review was conducted based on audiologic follow-up between 5 and 21 years. SETTING: The study was performed at two centers in Bari University Hospital, one performing vestibular neurectomy as the first surgical procedure for Meinere's disease and the other, endolymphatic mastoid shunt. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Of 68 patients with intractable idiopathic Meniere's disease, 29 underwent middle fossa vestibular neurectomy, and 17 had endolymphatic mastoid shunt; 22 were offered surgery but declined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were puretone average (PTA), speech reception threshold, and speech discrimination score before and after treatment. RESULTS: PTA declined by an average of 9.3 dB in neurectomy patients, 13.3 dB in patients undergoing endolymphatic mastoid shunt, and 18.1 dB in patients who were offered surgery but declined. Patients were subdivided into two cohorts based on their preoperative or initial PTA. In the patients who had PTA scores worse than 50 dB initially, the PTA declined an average of 4.3 dB in the vestibular neurectomy group, 11.5 dB in the endolymphatic sac group, and 4 dB in the nonsurgical group. In the patients with PTA > or = 50 dB initially, the PTA declined an average of of 25.3 dB in the vestibular neurectomy group, 16.1 in the endolymphatic sac group, and 26.2 dB in the nonsurgical group. Although shunt patients with good hearing initially deteriorated less than neurectomy patients and less than patients who declined surgery, the difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that patients with poor hearing stabilized, while patients with good hearing continued to deteriorate. The same conditions were observed in the patients who had surgery and those who were offered surgery but declined.

%X Of 131 children with bacteriologically verified Haemophilus influenzae meningitis, 75 were treated with ampicillin sodium and 45 with a combination of chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, and penicillin G sodium during the first 72 hours. Audiological and neuro-otologic examinations performed 1 to 15 years later showed that 3 patients were totally deaf, 11 had moderate and 15 minimal hearing losses, and 6 had vestibular disorders. All three deaf children and all those with recognized vestibular disorders had been treated with ampicillin. The severe sequelae, both otologic and nonotologic, tended to occur in children of the lower social groups. There were 15 ears with moderate hearing loss; the lesion was cochlear in nine and retrocochlea in four; it could not be localized in two. Ampicillin was given in relatively low dosage, but the results strongly support the value of chloramphenicol of "triple therapy" as weapons against H influenzae meningitis.

%X Sixteen children with anomalies of the auricle and/or middle ear who presented malformations of the face, mouth, upper airway, spine, limbs, heart, gastrointestinal (GI), and/or genitourinary (GU) systems, were described. While clusters of anomalies suggested syndromes such as the oculo-auriculo-vertebral syndrome of Goldenhar, hamifacial microsomia, mandibulo-facial dysostosis (Treacher Collins syndrome), Pierre Robin, Klippel-Feil, Moebius, Duane, and/or VATER syndromes, many children did not fit what are usually considered even minimal criteria for these syndromes. Several children had malformations which fit the description of more than one syndrome. The importance of investigating the children for unsuspected anomalies, especially of the GU system, was emphasized. Life threatening problems in this group consisted of airway problems, congenital heart disease, and major anomalies of the GI and GU systems. Better management of sucking, swallowing and airway problems might have decreased the early morbidity and mortality (3/16) in this group. Children with multiple defacing anomalies may not be mentally retarded so that aggressive management of their visceral anomalies and hearing problems, and early educational intervention are mandatory. Delay in development may be due to hearing loss, vestibular impairment, ataxia, the consequences of early malnutrition, and multiple hospitalizations rather than to mental retardation. A pessimistic attitude in infancy is unwarranted since it is impossible to predict which children will end up competitive individuals.

%X Responsibility for detection of hearing loss at the earliest possible age rests on the shoulders of the medical profession. Early detection and presentation of language through all available sensory channels, most notably the visual, are essential since deaf children of hearing parents, the vast majority of the deaf, characteristically remain grossly deficient linguistically despite years of special schooling. The deaf children of deaf parents, who are not as deprived linguistically since they learn a manual language at the normal age of language acquisition, tend to be less severely handicapped than the deaf children of hearing parents. Deafness is a hidden handicap in infancy although lack of vestibular function may delay motor milestones like sitting and walking but does not constitute a serious problem after they are achieved. The average 18 year old deaf student achieves a reading level comparable to that of a hearing fourth grader and the mathematical skills of a sixth grader. He is also deficient in science, social studies, and general information despite his average scores on nonverbal intelligence tests. Although many deaf students drop out of school before graduation and few go on to higher education, congenitally deaf adults are usually self-supporting and independent. Eighty per cent of the deaf marry hearing impaired persons. The deaf are greatly assisted by the cohesive deaf community existing in every sizable city which provides a social, recreational, and economic framework to their lives. As a result, delinquency and psychiatric illness are not higher among the deaf than the hearing, despite the difficulties they have dealing with the complexities of the hearing society.

%X Severe pathological changes were observed in the inner ear tissues of a 2-month-old patient who died of Reye's syndrome after 5 days of hospitalization. In the organ of Corti, the inner hair cells appeared to be more severely damaged than the outer hair cells. Various degrees of degeneration were observed in all non-sensory epithelial cells lining the cochlear duct. In most turns of the cochlear duct, Reissner's membrane was ruptured and/or collapsed onto the organ of Corti. Likewise, both sensory and non-sensory cells of the vestibular end organs were markedly degenerated. These observations suggest that the inner ear tissues are acutely affected in patients with Reye's syndrome, and that the changes may cause impairment of hearing and/or equilibrium in patients who recover.

%X Congenital inner ear anomalies are reported in temporal bones of a 22- month-old boy with Waardenburg's syndrome and Hirschsprung's disease. Although no changes in the central auditory pathway were identified, peripheral lesions of the cochlear and vestibular membranous labyrinth were observed. Bilateral atrophy of the organ of Corti and stria, and a sparsity of spiral ganglion cells were observed in the cochlea. Degeneration of the vestibular end organs, including a loss of Scarpa's ganglion cells, was also seen. This is the first report of temporal bone histopathology associated with Waardenburg's syndrome and Hirschsprung's disease. The pathoembryology of these inner ear anomalies associated with aganglionosis of the colon supports the hypothesis that Waardenburg's syndrome and Hirschsprung's disease are hereditary defects of neural crest cells.

%X Temporal bones were examined from a 14-year-old male who died of sequelae of congenital cytomegalic inclusion disease (CID). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was not isolated from inner ear fluid or multiple systemic tissues at the time of death. Examination of temporal bones revealed chronic pathology of both cochlear and vestibular sensory and nonsensory tissues. Endolymphatic hydrops was observed in the basal turn of the cochlear duct, while Reissner's membrane was collapsed in the more apical turns. Strial atrophy and a loss of cochlear hair cells were observed along the entire length of the basilar membrane. Vestibular neuroepithelial regions were degenerated and fibrosis was seen within the vestibular perilymphatic tissue spaces, suggesting prior labyrinthitis within the perilymph compartment in addition to the more typical pattern of endolabyrinthitis associated with human CMV infection. Distention of the saccular membrane was evident. In both cochlear and vestibular tissues, there were isolated regions of calcifications that appeared characteristic to that reported in other organ systems of individuals with CID. Collectively, these chronic, pathological findings in this case of CID demonstrate more extensive injury than has been identified in the previously reported acute temporal bone pathology of CID.

%X As part of a comprehensive study on sequelae after pneumococcal meningitis, 94 of 111 consecutive survivors were re-examined 4 to 16 years after discharge. Twenty-three patients had otological sequelae after pneumococcal meningitis. In these patients, 17 had hearing losses, 7 had tinnitus, 9 had vertigo, 13 had vestibular areflexia, 4 had loss of smell, and 3 had loss of taste. Among the patients with hearing loss, 4 were bilaterally deaf, 6 were unilaterally deaf, and 2 had mild and 5 had slight hearing losses. From correlations with extensive data from the medical records, preadmission antibiotic treatment appeared to protect from acousticovestibular damage. Purulent otitis media and otosurgical intervention did not correlate to the fatality rate or the development of sequelae. Acute purulent otitis media appeared as a concomitant manifestation, rather than the focus of pneumococcal meningitis.

It involves retrosigmoid craniotomy, removing the posterior wall of the IAC to the singular canal and exposing the cochlear nerve and every branch of the vestibular nerve. It can provide the accurate transection of the vestibular nerve. We suggest the operative indication should be expanded to cochlear neurectomy, for the operation can provide the accurate transection of the cochlear nerve too. A case of cochlear neurectomy, 2 cases of vestibular neurectomy were performed by this method. The operations were successful.

%X The Rice Infant Sensorimotor Stimulation (RISS) treatment was given to 15 premature infants to determine effects on neurophysiological development. The mothers of the infants were trained to administer the treatment for 15 minutes, 4 times a day, for 1 month, beginning the day the infant arrived home from the hospital. When each infant in the study (15 experimental and 14 control) was 4 months postnatal age, he/she was examined by a pediatrician, a psychologist, and a pediatric nurse who had no knowledge of which infant was experimental or control. The results indicated the experimental infants made significant gains in neurological development (p less than .001), weight gain (p less than .04), and mental development (p less than .05). The findings of this research indicate that early and systematic stimulation of the nerve pathways of the skin and of the vestibular nerve cells can accelerate growth and development of premature infants.

The mean numbers of counts decreased beginning in the age group between 50 and 60 years. Neuronal populations from cases with Meniere disease and otosclerosis were compared to the respective "normal" values. Endolymphatic hydrops could be excluded as the cause of degeneration of Scarpa's ganglion in Meniere' disease. In cases of otosclerosis reduced neuronal counts were found if lesions were large enough to include the cribrose areas.

%X This study provides a detailed report of the distribution and density of substance P-like immunoreactive fibres and terminals within the human infant medulla. Seven brains with no signs of macroscopic alteration fixed usually within 24-48 h after death were used. Free floating transverse sections (50-60 microns) were then immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against substance P using the avidin-biotin- peroxidase technique. Morphologically three types of substance P-like immunoreactive fibres were observed: those with small varicosities of less than 1 micron, those with medium varicosities of 1-2 microns and those with large varicosities of 2-4 microns. Very dense substance P- like immunoreactivity was present within the spinal trigeminal nucleus, parts of the gracile and cuneate fasciculi and the paracommissural subnucleus of the solitary nucleus; dense substance P-like immunoreactivity was present within the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve, commissural, medial, dorsal, dorsolateral ventral and ventrolateral subnuclei of the solitary nuclear complex, parasolitary nucleus, raphe obscurus, inferior olivary complex (medial, dorsal, dorsomedial nuclei) and ventrolateral part of the dorsal reticular nucleus; moderate substance P-like immunoreactivity was present within the gelatinosus nucleus of the solitary tract, lateral reticular nucleus proper, intermediate reticular zone and parvocellular reticular nucleus; sparse substance P-like immunoreactivity was present within the hypoglossal nucleus, retroambigual nucleus and much of the reticular formation (dorsal, parvocellular, ventral gigantocellular, dorsal paragigantocellular nuclei): and very sparse substance P-like immunoreactivity was present within the nucleus ambiguus, medial vestibular nucleus and parts of the reticular formation (ventral, medial, gigantocellular, ventral gigantocellular, dorsal paragigantocellular nuclei). Substance P-like immunoreactivity was absent in the area postrema, intercalated nucleus, gracile and cuneate nuclei, in the epiolivary, subtrigeminal and parvocellular divisions of the lateral reticular nucleus, spinal vestibular nucleus, and in the solitary and pyramidal tracts. In several regions the substance P-like immunoreactive fibres formed distinct pericellular arrays around the somata and dendrites of neurons (hypoglossal nucleus, dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve, retroambigual nucleus, intermediate reticular zone). The results indicate the high specificity of the localization of substance P in various structures of the brainstem and underline the presumed significance of this peptide in autonomic and sensorimotor functions of the brain.

Videotape Recording
%X Using videographic analyses, we identified and quantified maternal contributions to the sensory environment of the perinatal rat (Rattus norvegicus) by analyzing, from the offspring's perspective, the dam's activities during gestation, labor, and delivery. Our observations indicate that pregnant females remain highly active during the final week of gestation, as compared with nonpregnant control animals. Exploratory movements, feeding, drinking, self-grooming, and other activities of the rat dam pitch, turn, accelerate, and expose fetuses to mechanical pressures. During parturition uterine contractions and maternal licking and handling provide vigorous tactile and vestibular stimuli to pups. Newly born pups are exposed to intense thermal stimulation, cooling rapidly to the temperature of the postnatal environment. Our results suggest that fetal and newborn rats are exposed during development to a broad range of maternally produced stimuli.

%X The primary purpose of the present study was to analyze quantitatively the vestibular evoked Moro response, and the symmetry of the movement pattern involved, as the traditional descriptions bring about. Another aim was to determine the segmental movements involved and determine whether the components of the Moro response are dependent on changes in the infant's behavioral state. Another question concerns whether the form of these movements changed over repeated trials on the same day, or from the first to the fifth day after birth. Vestibular evoked Moro responses of 52 neonates, 1-5 days of age, elicited in different behavior states (State 1-5), were examined and quantitatively analyzed. The response was evoked by a predefined, rapid, downward, vertical body motion, without any dorsiflexion of the infant's head. Optoelectronic device (SELSPOT II) were used to monitor the arm/hand movement patterns involved in the response. The three-dimensional movement pattern in space, duration, velocity, latency, and the acceleration of both arms/hands were analyzed in relation to the infant's behavioral state. The response movements were structured into phases of abduction/extension, adduction/flexion and the extension/flexion of the fingers. The vestibular stimulation used was found to be sufficient for eliciting an adequate Moro response. The segmental movement pattern of the Moro response was found to be sensitive to the infant's behavioral state at the time when the response was elicited. This was found in the movement pattern, duration, latency, and the velocity of the response. The response was found to be asymmetrical, in 82% of the infants it was found to be a predominant shorter onset latency of the right arm, in 12% the opposite was found. These findings suggest that there is a fundamental, spinal asymmetry involved in the Moro response which is subject to supraspinal influences emanating from the vestibulospinal system. No differences were found between 1 and 5 days of age for any of the scoring categories, and no differences were found within groups over six successive trials.

%X Head turning after release from the midline and the Moro response to a full-body drop in 15 full-term newborns lying supine on a custom-built platform was studied. While the lateral bias for head turning was not as pronounced as for the Moro response, it was still assumed in the ratio of 2 (right):1 (left) as predicted by Previc (1991). Onset latency and time-to-peak acceleration were both significantly shorter in the right arm during the initial phase of the Moro response. For both measures, this right arm bias persisted over four consecutive elicitations in most infants. Vaginally delivered infants and those born by Caesarean section did not differ in terms of head preference and the two measures of arm advantage. Our main finding was that infants with a right-sided head preference had a consistently shorter onset latency for the right arm. We interpret this association as stemming from a common labyrinthine asymmetry that involves different vestibulospinal pathways for the neck and arm muscles. In general, our findings are discussed in the context of Previc's (1991) left-otolithic dominance hypothesis and Grattan, De Vos, Levy, and McClintock's (1992) model of newborn functional asymmetries.

%X Cardiac and behavioral responses to a tactual stimulus were evaluated during the first sleep cycle for 3 groups of infants: 30 full terms, 30 nonintervened preterms, and 30 intervened preterms. Prior to testing, the latter group had received a regimen of multimodal sensory stimulation, which emphasized the tactual and vestibular modalities. The results showed that the intervention altered the preterms' sensory functioning mainly during active sleep. In this state, the full terms and the intervened preterms exhibited a significant cardiac acceleration to the stimulus, while the nonintervened preterms failed to do so. Similarly, the behavioral response of the intervened preterm more closely approximated that of the full terms. During quiet sleep the intervention did not affect either the cardiac or the behavioral response. In this sleep state, the full terms' cardiac response was that of monophasic acceleration, whereas both groups of preterms exhibited a biphasic response with a smaller initial acceleration which was followed by a deceleration below baseline. Behaviorally, the preterms responded less frequently and gave smaller responses than the full terms. Thus there were marked differences between preterms and full terms, and the intervention seemed to narrow this gap to some extent.

%X A study of the vestibular end organs from humans of different ages is presented. The inner ears were exposed by microdissection, and the vestibular sensory regions were either sectioned and studied with light or electron microscopy, or prepared and studied with the surface specimen technique. A change, which can be related to aging, is the accumulation of lipofuscin inclusions in sensory and supporting cells, especially pronounced in the type I sensory cell. Changes of the hair bundles, such as disarrangement of cilia, increased fragility of cilia and formation of giant cilia, have also been observed in aged individuals. In three cases there was a history of vestibular disturbance of vertigo. All three cases had shown caloric hypo- reactivity. In two cases, one with a history of herpes zoster oticus and another with a brain stem glioma, no morphological changes which could be attributed to the diseases, were found. The third case showed degeneration of macula utriculi and the lateral and superior cristae, possibly as a result of vascular disturbance.

To the authors' knowledge, supernumerary vestibular sensory epithelial structures and an inner ear epidermoid cyst have not been previously reported. Wide communications between the subarachnoid space and inner ear were of surgical relevance.

Many of the abnormalities previously described were seen in the present cases; namely, atresia of the external auditory canal, aberrant course of the tensor tympani muscle, malformed stapes, aberrant course of the facial nerve with an obtuse angulation at the first genu and displacement of geniculate ganglion cells into the internal auditory canal, shortened cochlea with decreased spiral ganglion cell population, and vestibular anomalies, such as bony and membranous blockage of the superior semicircular canal. Moreover, an extremely underdeveloped malleus and incus continuous with a persistent Meckel's cartilage were observed.

%X Tetracycline and its congeners demonstrate antimicrobial activity against bacteria, Chlamydiae and Toxoplasma gondii. Ophthalmologists can use these drugs to treat bacterial and chlamydial infections, and also for ocular rosacea and similar disorders. Side effects associated with systemic tetracycline use are most commonly related to the gastrointestinal tract and to signs of yeast superinfection. Minocycline use may be limited by its vestibular toxicity. Temporary growth retardation and staining of erupting teeth may occur with oral use of tetracycline in children under 8 years; these drugs should not be given in pregnancy or to young children. Topical tetracycline application yields good tear and aqueous humor concentrations.

Vestibule/*physiology
%X Body rocking, head banging, and head rolling--three rhythmic behaviors that involve stimulation of the vestibular system--were studies in 525 normal children. Data analyses focused on two issues: (1) the prevalence and duration of these habits and their relationship to child and family factors and (2) the hypothesis that children who persistently displayed such behaviors would be reported as developmentally more advanced than "non-self-stimulators." Body rocking was the earliest to appear and most prevalent of the three habits. Head banging and head rolling had roughly the same prevalence and age of onset. Comparisons of "self-stimulators" with "non-self-stimulators" yielded no significant effects for birth order or SES; only for head banging was a significant (3:1) ratio of males to females found. A comparison of the ages at which 12 "milestones" first appeared supported the hypothesis of developmental precocity for the body rockers and the head bangers, but not for the head rollers.

%X Vestibular influences on breathing pattern were investigated in 18 premature infants in the neonatal intensive care nursery. Respiratory abdominal movements were recorded while the babies were manually rocked at varying rates between 30 and 60 cycles/min (cpm). Coherence spectra were estimated between the respiratory and rocker signals, and their magnitudes were evaluated at the rocking frequency, with coherence spectra > 0.85 indicative of strong entrainment to rocking. At least one incident of entrainment was seen in 15 of 18 infants, with 2:1 ratios (2 breaths/rocker cycle) occurring at rocking frequencies of 30- 40 cpm (8 of 18 subjects) and 1:1 entrainment at rates of 42-50 cpm (5 of 18 subjects). More complex synchronization was observed in three infants, with patterns consisting of alternans between 2:1 and 3:2 ratios (5:3 entrainment). Infants > 35 wk postconceptional age exhibited greater coherence to rocking than infants < 35 wk (P < 0.01), indicating a maturational change in the reflex may occur. Results show that the natural stimulation of rocking a newborn provides a phasic input to its respiratory pattern generator that is capable of resetting the system's oscillation and entraining its rhythm.

%X This study investigated congenital anomalies occurring in the inner ear, with particular attention to their features, localizations, and frequencies. Seventy-seven human temporal bones obtained from 53 individuals, aged one day to 39 years, each of whom had anomalies of the external ear, middle ear, and/or inner ear, were used for this study. The temporal bones had been removed at autopsy, fixed, dehydrated, embedded in celloidin, and sectioned horizontally or vertically at 20 microns. Every tenth horizontal section or every 20th vertical section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin, mounted, and studied under a light microscope. There were 206 inner ear anomalies (117 in the vestibular system, 79 in the cochlea, 10 in the internal auditory meatus) in the 51 bones studied. Fifty-four different features of anomalies were present at 33 different locations in the inner ear. The most frequent anomalies observed were shortened cochlea (23 bones), enlarged vestibule (17 bones), wide cochlear aqueduct (16 bones), absence of lateral semicircular canal (14 bones), and large osseous lateral semicircular canal (10 bones). The most common site of inner ear anomalies was thus the lateral semicircular canal, which was involved in 46 of the 206 anomalies observed; the anomalies in this organ were variable in type. The implications of inner ear anomalies are discussed as they relate to fetal development, inner ear dysfunction, and clinical interpretation of polytomographic studies.

Vestibular Nerve/*anatomy & histology
%X We reconstructed in three dimensions, and measured by a computer-aided method developed by us, Scarpa's ganglion and surrounding important anatomical structures in 7 normal human temporal bones obtained from 7 individuals aged 7 days to 72 years. We found that this ganglion is shaped like an hourglass and lies with its superior part directed anterosuperolaterally, and its inferior part posteroinferomedially; these two parts are connected by the isthmus ganglionaris. Although the dimensions of the parts of the ganglion varied, such a structure was distinguishable in all the specimens we studied. The volume of the ganglion was found to be relatively consistent in these postnatal specimens; although the width and height of the ganglion varied, they were inversely correlated with each other (linear regression analysis, p < 0.05). We did note, however, some postnatal increase in the distance from the ganglion to its neighboring structures. We also identified a significant correlation between the width of the ganglion and the length of the internal auditory canal and the distance from the ganglion to the vestibular endorgans in any given specimen (linear regression analysis, p < 0.05). These results suggest that although the volume of Scarpa's ganglion does not change after birth, its shape does change with the growth of the individual temporal bone.

%X Benign paroxysmal torticollis is a condition characterized by attacks of head-tilting often accompanied by lateral curvature of the trunc. The first onset of these attacks usually occurs during the first months of life and they recur with a remarkable periodicity for 6--12 months after which time they gradually subside in intensity and frequency. As a rule the attacks have ceased completely before the age of 2 years but in some cases they continue in a modified form as attacks of ataxia. The aetiology is unknown and there is no evidence of bilateral peripheral vestibular disturbances as has been suggested in earlier reports. The ataxia seen in some cases rather suggests a dysfunction of the cerebellum or of the vestibulo-cerebellar connections. Four own patients with this syndrome are presented and discussed.

%X The temporal bone and the brain stem of an infant with Cornelia de Lange syndrome, aged 9 months, were studied histopathologically. Abnormalities in the inner ear included short cochlea, dilated vestibule, and mesenchyme-filled perilymphatic spaces of the vestibule and semicircular canals. The inner and outer hair cells were normal. Many spiral ganglion cells, which normally would be located in the canal of Rosenthal, were seen in the internal auditory meatus. Some of the vestibular ganglion cells intruded into the facial nerve. The facial nerve formed a loose curve and the geniculum was difficult to recognize. The middle ear was filled with mesenchyme, and there was marked dehiscence of the facial canal. The brain stem, particularly the pons, was smaller than normal, while the fourth ventricle was dilated. The microscopic observation of the pons revealed weak staining with Luxol Fast Blue and decreased number of oligodendroglia. These findings suggested the malformation of the myelin of transverse fibers.

%X Using a computer-aided three-dimensional reconstruction and measurement method, the authors studied the shape and dimensions of Scarpa's ganglion and interrelations of the ganglion to nearby important anatomical structures in 10 normal human temporal bones obtained from 10 individuals of different ages (12 gestational weeks to 72 years). In the postnatal cases, Scarpa's ganglion was shaped like a distorted hourglass. Although the shape of the ganglion varied somewhat among specimens, a superior division, inferior division, and isthmus ganglionaris were distinguishable in each case. Volume of the ganglion was relatively consistent after birth, so that width and height of the ganglion were inversely correlated with each other (linear regression analysis, P less than .05). There seemed to be, however, a possible postnatal increase in the distances from the ganglion to neighboring structures and in the length of the internal auditory canal; these increases were probably the result of postnatal growth of the temporal bone. Moreover, the width of the ganglion in any single specimen was found to correlate significantly positively with the distances from the ganglion to the vestibular end-organs and the length of the internal auditory canal in that specimen (linear regression analysis, P less than .01). This finding suggests that Scarpa's ganglion may be elongated secondary to the elongation of the vestibular nerve due to the growth of the temporal bone. In fetuses, each portion of the ganglion was less clearly identifiable than that portion in postnatal cases. The dimensions of Scarpa's ganglion were found to have reached maturity around the time of birth.

%X Using a computer-aided three-dimensional reconstruction and measurement method, 12 measurements were made to determine the dimensions of the maculae, cristae ampullares, and semicircular canals in 18 temporal bones from nine pairs of age-matched male and female individuals (1 day to 76 years old). The surface areas of the utricular and saccular maculae were significantly larger in male than in female specimens (two- way analysis of variance, F = 9.00, df = 1, p less than 0.01; F = 4.57, df = 1, p less than 0.05, respectively). The width of the utricular macula and the length of the saccular macula were also significantly greater in male than in female specimens (two-way analysis of variance, F = 5.17, df = 1, p less than 0.05; F = 4.33, df = 1, p less than 0.05, respectively). Finally, the three semicircular canals were larger in diameter in male vs. female specimens; this difference was statistically significant for the superior semicircular canal (two-way analysis of variance, F = 10.74, df = 1, p less than 0.01). By contrast, none of these dimensions of those vestibular structures showed any significant change in size with advancing postnatal age. We propose from these findings that there appears to be sexual dimorphism in the vestibular apparatus.

%X We used a computer-aided three-dimensional reconstruction and measurement method to measure torsion of the the semicircular canals (SCCs) in 10 normal human temporal bones from 10 individuals (3 months to 76 years old). Torsion of each SCC was measured as the angle between the "standard line" (the line connecting the ampullated and nonampullated ends of the SCC) and the plane of greatest SCC torsion. Torsion was greatest for the anterior SCC (16.4 +/- 3.6 degrees), followed by the lateral SCC (9.5 +/- 6.7 degrees) and the posterior SCC (8.5 +/- 4.2 degrees). The angles between the overall plane described by each SCC and the other SCCs between the anterior and lateral, the anterior and posterior, and the posterior and lateral SCCs were also measured and were found to be 78.7 +/- 10.0, 107.9 +/- 5.5, and 87.3 +/- 6.9 degrees, respectively. Finally the angles between the torsion plane of each SCC and the others were measured and found to be 92.6 +/- 15.4, 95.8 +/- 11.2, and 90.9 +/- 8.3 degrees, respectively. These results indicate that on average torsion in the SCCs tend to bring the angle between pairs of SCCs close to a right angle. This tendency to have a right angle between SCCs is thought to promote optimal vestibular function. Speculation is offered regarding the etiology of the greater torsion of the anterior SCC.

%X The histological structure of the brain and spinal cord, visual, olfactory, auditory and vestibular analysers, and endocrine organs (epiphysis, hypophysis, thyroid and parathyroid glands) were investigated in newborn rats delivered by females who had been exposed to weightlessness a half of the pregnancy period. Analysers of the flight animals did not have any marked deviations from the norm. Loci of neurone degeneration resembling porencephaly but less massive were revealed in various brain portions (cortex, hypocampus, metencephalon, spinal cord) of the infant rats developed in space flight. Endocrine studies showed accelerated differentiation of the thyroid cells secreting thyroid hormones, C-cells, and parathyroid cells in most of the infant rats of the flight group. The test animals reduced the size of epiphysis and the number of pinealocytes. Adenohypophysis was found to be smaller with altered spatial distribution of the trabecular system. The changes look quite impressive but do not threaten viability of the animals.

%X Morbidity risks continue to constitute a major problem for the premature infant, despite striking progress in neonatal care and technology. This article reviews the early stimulation literature over the past 15 years, and discusses the findings of improved weight gain, respiratory status and psychomotor development when infants are stimulated early in life. Although some authors have criticized this area of research because of methodological problems, the overwhelming evidence points to the beneficial consequences of tactile and vestibular stimulation programs in high-risk nurseries. Further research is, however, clearly indicated in order to more fully elucidate the major variables and mechanisms responsible for the experimental effects, and to elaborate a more standardized program of psychological care of premature infants.

%X This article reviews the literature and presents data from our laboratories on sensory deprivation stress and supplemental stimulation of the rat pup and the preterm neonate. The data suggest that the effects of maternal deprivation in the rat pup (suppression of growth hormone release and protein synthesis) are regulated by a specific form of tactile stimulation: only brush stroking of maternally deprived rat pups returned growth parameters to normal; other forms of stimulation, including kinesthetic and vestibular stimulation, were ineffective in restoring normal functions. Other data are presented demonstrating that very small preterm neonates given tactile-kinesthetic stimulation gain more weight per day, spend more time awake and active, and show more mature habituation, orientation, motor, and range of state behaviors on the Brazelton assessment.

The right petrous bone was hypoplastic and showed total superior dehiscence of the internal acoustic meatus. Th otic capsule was deformed with an underdeveloped cochlear modiolus grossly deficient in spiral ganglion population. The spiralling cochlear shell showed partial deficiency of the interscalar septum between the middle and apical coils. The cochlear duct was shorter than that on the normal side; the organ of Corti however was normal. The vestibular system did not show any structural abnormality except for the degeneration and reduction of the Scarpa's ganglion cells and nerve fibers. An additional interesting fact was that the facial nerve was totally absent in the temporal bone except for its nervus intermedius component.

Motor function was measured one week and 18 weeks after treatment, and the same gains were found for the control and experimental groups. These results conflict with a recent report that vestibular stimulation is an effective therapy for cerebral-palsied children.

Between 1977 and 1984, 214 exploratory tympanotomies for suspected perilymph fistula (PLF) were performed on 177 patients. One hundred six primary (initial) fistulas were found in 95 ears and 26 recurrent fistulas were identified. Eighty-two percent of the 91 patients with PLF had auditory symptoms, 8% with auditory symptoms as the sole complaint. Eighty-one percent of the patients had vestibular symptoms, 12% with vestibular symptoms alone. The type of hearing loss and the nature of the vestibular symptoms were widely variable. Of the 58 patients with preoperative auditory symptoms, 49% had improved hearing (23% improved to serviceable range), after closure of PLFs. Ninety-five percent of the patients who presented with vestibular symptoms had elimination of or decrease in their dizziness to the extent that it no longer interfered with their daily activities. The highest incidence of recurrent fistula was associated with grafts using fatty tissue. Patients with Mondini deformity were at particularly high risk for fistula recurrence.

%X A retrospective analysis of electronystagmograms recorded over 2 years from 90 children aged 1 to 3 with spastic diplegia due to the infantile cerebral paralysis was performed and its results correlated with the clinical course of the disease. The vestibulometric criteria were derived in order to predict the course of motor functions in the patients' postnatal ontogenesis. The causes of inefficacy of rehabilitation therapy were analyzed in children which had suffered from meningoencephalitis in their infancy. Specific features of the neurodynamic processes in these patients were displayed in their vestibulometric indices. Mesencephalic-cortical control mechanisms of the vestibular nystagmus were shown to normalize under effect of acupuncture. This accounts for its greater clinical efficacy as compared to the passive vestibular therapy which exerted beneficial influence over the bulbar-pontine nystagmogenic mechanisms.

%X Ocular motor apraxia (OMA) is a clinical sign involving the intermittent inability to initiate saccades, and a failure of quick phases during optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) and vestibular nystagmus (VN). Some patients have no other associated abnormalities (idiopathic), whereas others have a variety of neurological conditions. We quantified the severity of the saccade failure and correlated it with neuro-radiological and other oculomotor findings in 62 children (aged 17 days - 14 years). Saccades, smooth pursuit, OKN and VN were recorded using electrooculography and the extent of "locking up" (absent quick phases during OKN and VN) was measured. Saccades were usually hypometric. Pursuit and OKN gains were normal in the majority of the idiopathic cases but were low in those with other neurological conditions. Twenty-four patients had essentially normal scans, whereas 38 had abnormal scans: Delayed myelination, cerebellar abnormalities (particularly involving the vermis), and agenesis of the corpus callosum were the most common findings. A significant positive correlation was present between increasing neuro-radiological deficits and severity of "locking up" during OKN. Principal component analysis showed that brainstem and cerebellar vermis abnormalities were the main factors involved. A pathophysiological basis of OMA is discussed in the light of animal and clinical studies.

%X Ocular motor apraxia (OMA) is characterised by an intermittent inability to initiate voluntary saccades, and a failure to produce optokinetic and vestibular quick phases. Some patients have no other abnormalities (idiopathic OMA), whereas in others it appears associated with a variety of neurological conditions which may affect the sensory visual pathway. Electroretinograms (ERGs), flash and pattern visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and eye movements were assessed in 53 children with OMA (age range 17 days to 14 years) to determine their efficacy in helping to distinguish between idiopathic and non-idiopathic cases. Seven patients (13.2%) had idiopathic OMA and the remaining 46 (86.8%) had other associated clinical conditions. All patients had episodes of absent quick phases ('lock up') during optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) and/or vestibular testing. Flash ERGs were abnormal in only 7 patients (13.2%); 6 had syndromes involving a pigmentary retinopathy (Joubert's, Bardet-Biedl, infantile Refsum's, Kearns-Sayre's), and the seventh had a cone dystrophy with vermis hypoplasia. VEPs were normal in all 7 patients with idiopathic OMA. Thirty-three (72%) patients with OMA in association with neurological conditions had abnormal VEPs and 13 had normal VEPs (28%). There was a significant positive correlation between VEP abnormality and poor OKN gain. VEP/ERG testing and eye movement studies are useful when OMA is suspected as they help in distinguishing isolated idiopathic cases from those with more widespread neurological abnormalities.

%X A large negative deflection with a latency of 3 msec was observed in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) waveforms of 48 patients (6.5%), [59 ears (5.8%)] in 740 patients with profound peripheral deafness (1,009 ears) between 1978 and 1990 at our department. This negative deflection was termed the "N3 potential." We reviewed some of these patients and discuss some common characteristics found in abnormal ABR waveforms. We also inquired into the conditions and origins of these potentials. Although virtually all patients were less than 10 years of age, the N3 potential was also observed in the ABR waveform of adult patients. There were no sex differences. In the majority of patients audiograms showed no response to the maximum output of an andiometer in the high frequency range and a residual response in the low frequency range. The most common cause of deafness was "unknown" in children, and "sudden deafness" in adults. The N3 potentials were noted at intensities of 80 dBnHL or greater. A high repetition rate (83.3/sec) of the click stimulus influenced the latency and amplitude of the N3 potential. As the stimulus intensity increased, the amplitude of the potential increased, and the latency decreased. The potential was replicated on retesting within less than a month. The N3 potential had a consistent latency and amplitude over the scalp. We conclude that the N3 potential was a physiological "neural" response evoked by a loud sound rather than by an electrical artifact. The N3 potential was most likely not an auditory evoked response or a response from a semicircular canal, because of the 3-msec latency and sharpness of the waveform, with lack of vertigo. The results suggest that the N3 potential may be a saccular acoustic response.

%X Despite potential nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, aminoglycosides are widely used in the treatment of severe sepsis but monitoring of serum levels is necessary. The use and assay of aminoglycosides, together with microbiologists' and pharmacists' advice on dosage and potential toxicity were examined in a teaching hospital group during an eight week period. A total of 480 courses of aminoglycoside was recorded in 440 hospital in-patients and of these, 306 (64%) were for prophylaxis. For 79 (45%) of 174 therapeutic courses, bacteriological results were available at the start and the choice of antibiotic was appropriate in 69 cases. Serum aminoglycoside assays were performed in 86% (149/174) of therapeutic courses. Correct assay request forms were used in 79% of 473 assay requests, and the clinical diagnosis was given on 73% of forms. In so-called peak samples with a documented time of collection, this ranged from 5 min to over 9 h post dose. Potentially toxic concentrations were present in 56 (12%) serum samples from 50 courses, in ten of which there was a serum creatinine rise of > 40 microM. However, there were confounding factors in five cases. Probable nephrotoxicity was rare, although assays were not performed in 14% of therapeutic courses. There were no symptomatic cases of ototoxicity but audiometry and vestibular studies were not performed. Closer liaison between the microbiologists, pharmacists and clinical staff is essential to improve clinical practice. Computer notification of inadequately monitored courses would be helpful. The routine therapeutic use of aminoglycosides needs to be reviewed in the light of the rising costs of assay litigation and the increasing number of alternative antibiotics available.

%X Control of head position during postural responses is important to facilitate both the interpretation of vestibular signals and the stabilization of gaze. In these experiments, we compared head stabilization for two different postural tasks: 1) in response to perturbations at the head, and 2) in response to perturbations induced at the support surface, which perturb both body and head position. To determine whether normal vestibular function is necessary for head stabilization in these two tasks, responses to forward and backward mechanical perturbations of the head and body were compared for 13 normal subjects and 4 patients with profound bilateral vestibular loss (two with vestibular loss in adulthood and two in infancy). Normal subjects showed little neck muscle activity for body perturbations, but large, early activations in both neck extensors and flexors for head perturbations. In contrast, vestibular patients showed excessive neck muscle activation for body perturbations and reduced or absent neck muscle activity for head perturbations. Patients with vestibular loss in adulthood also showed increased head acceleration in response to both head and body perturbations, but patients with vestibular loss in infancy showed more normal head accelerations. For body perturbations, the differences in head acceleration between patients and normals were greater for later head acceleration peaks, indicating poor head control during the execution of the postural response. Trunk angle changes were also higher in the patients for forward body perturbations, indicating that poorer control of trunk position could have contributed to their poorer head stabilization. These results indicate that the vestibular system plays an important role in head and trunk stabilization for both head and body perturbations. However, the more normal head accelerations of the patients with infant vestibular loss also indicate that other mechanisms, possibly involving neck reflexes, can at least partially substitute for the vestibular system to provide head and trunk stabilization.

%X We compared 20 cases of bicoronal craniosyntosis (BCC) using the linear and angular values of the normal statistical material for the same age and sex. The skull in BCC is significantly shortened and flattened but with normal width. The height of the frontal arch (FNBR) is significantly decreased. The base of the skull is depressed with angle AB2 significantly increased, and angle NTNO significantly decreased and, even in some cases, with negative angular values. This is inducing a sinking of LEA (length from N to T), and in some cases LEA is lower than the line LNO (distance from N to O). The cephalic index (CI) was significantly increased, and the calculated cranial capacity (CC) was significantly decreased. Bregma (BR) is moving anteriorly in BCC, inducing an anterior movement of the calvaria with a bulge around BR. In this anterior movement we designate lack of positive occipital rotation. In BCC there is an evident lack of positive occipital rotation. Superimposing our drawings on the reference line NBA, we found for the first time a movement of anatomical landmarks similar to that observed in the negative occipital rotation in vestibular orientation.

%X Vestibular function tests were performed on a series of 57 children between the ages of 1 and 16 years. Inattention and immaturity of eye movement control created difficulties in the analysis of the electronystagmography traces in some instances. With the eyes closed, spontaneous and positional nystagmus occurred in 20% of asymptomatic children and this was thought to be physiological. Changes in external ear pressure (fistula test) enhanced this spontaneous nystagmus. Smooth pursuit ataxia and optokinetic abnormalities were common in the children with reading disabilities and those with congenital deafness, and were thought to be soft neurological signs of brainstem dysfunction. The torsion swing chair test was acceptable and gave easily readable responses. Caloric abnormalities were very common in children with reading disabilities and provided useful information in those with congenital and acquired disorders of hearing and balance. It was concluded that normal data were required for children of all ages in order to improve our understanding of electronystagmography in children.

The nystagmus differed in its location of the null zone, its frequency and amplitude, the degree of persistence in the dark, and the degree of impairment of pursuit and optokinetic nystagmus. As the two boys have the identical genetic constitution, we postulate that the discordant features of the nystagmus represent variable expressivity or, alternatively, the influence of environmental factors.

%X Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is currently reported as the most common cause of congenital viral induced deafness. However, few systematic studies of the audiovestibular sequelae of this infection are present in the literature. A clinical pathologic study was conducted from 1976 to 1982 to evaluate this. Fifty-two pairs of infant and children's temporal bone studied demonstrated no evidence of CMV endolabyrinthitis even in the single case with evidence of extensive congenital CMV infection. Over 2,000 umbilical cord sera were screened to detect asymptomatic CMV infection with an incidence of 0.38% (and slightly greater than 1% when extrapolated to correct for the sensitivity of the method of detection) in a central Pennsylvania study population. No sensorineural abnormalities were detected in five asymptomatic children and 30 control children. However, three out of six (50%) infants, symptomatic at birth and followed to a mean age of 5.5 years, showed significant and progressive sensorineural loss and vestibular deficits.

%X The purpose of this report is to present a review of the clinical and histopathologic findings in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) labyrinthitis. Human cytomegalovirus infection was first recognized in its congenital disseminated form and, subsequently, in a subclinical form. In 1968, the first temporal bone demonstration of endolabyrinthine infection was reported. To date, there have been reports made on only nine temporal bones in infants with HCMV infection. The light microscopic findings, in general, have been similar, with cytomegalovirus inclusion-bearing cells involving the nonneuroepithelial cells in both the cochlear and vestibular endolabyrinth. A few cases have been studied with fluorescent antibody methods, but have resulted in conflicting reports regarding the presence of virus in cells of the organ of Corti and spiral ganglia. Subclinical congenital HCMV infection, including labyrinthine infection, has also been studied. Only two groups have performed major prospective studies along with systematic and careful periodic audiologic evaluation in cytomegalovirus congenitally infected children. Their findings demonstrated significant hearing loss in 33% to 48% of symptomatic patients and in 6.9% to 13% of asymptomatic children. There also was evidence of progressive hearing loss in some of these children. Vestibular dysfunction is less well characterized. The long-term sequelae may include Meniere's syndrome. Acquired HCMV infection in children and adults has not been demonstrated histopathologically, although it has been associated with sudden deafness and acute labyrinthitis. This observation is based primarily on serologic data.

%X During the years 1975 through 1981 we performed exploratory tympanotomies on 33 infants and children (44 ears) to verify the presumptive diagnosis of perilymph fistula (PLF). A PLF was identified at the round window, oval window, or both in 29 (66%) of the 44 ears explored. After surgery hearing was unchanged in 86%, improved in 5%, and worsened in 9% of the ears in which PLFs had been observed. Complaints of vertigo subsided in all children in whom a PLF was repaired. Preoperative factors determined to be highly suggestive of the presence of a PLF included the following: sudden onset of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), congenital deformities of the head, and abnormal findings on tomograms of the temporal bones, especially Mondini-like inner ear dysplasias. Middle ear abnormalities (primarily congenital) were observed in 20 of the 44 ears. Abnormal results of preoperative vestibular function studies, which included a fistula test, and sex were not consistently found to be associated with an observed PLF at tympanotomy.

No differences of qualitative character were found in the bacterial flora of the saliva and the dental plaques in children with "bottle caries" in relation to those without caries. A significant correlation was noted between the quantity of S. mutans and Lactobacillus in the saliva or dental plaque and the intensity of caries. These results confirm the suggestions of other authors that Str. mutans plays an important role in caries and that it is the prevailing species among acid-producing flora in children with bottle caries.

%X OBJECTIVE: To determine the pattern of neural tumors (schwannomas, vestibular schwannomas [acoustic neuromas], and meningiomas) that developed in 3013 people who received radiation treatment with x-ray beam therapy for benign conditions of the head and neck area before their 16th birthday. METHODS: The surgical and pathology reports and pathology slides were reviewed for all neural tumors in the cohort. Patients with more than 1 neural tumor were compared with those with 1 neural tumor and those with no neural tumors. RESULTS: There were 7 patients with multiple neural tumors and 63 with single neural tumors. The distribution of tumors in these 2 groups differed. The group with multiple tumors had more spinal nerve root schwannomas, while the group with single tumors had more cranial nerve schwannomas. Six of the 7 patients did not meet the diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type 2. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that host factors that increase susceptibility to radiation may be involved in the development of the multiple neural tumors. Clinically, patients with multiple neural tumors who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type 2 should be questioned about radiation exposure. If exposure is confirmed, then screening for other radiation-related tumors should be initiated.

%X It is very valuable for temporal bone morphologists to be able to recognize temporal bone serial sections in three dimensions and to be able to measure temporal bone structures three-dimensionally. We can now do 3-dimensional reconstruction to visualize the structures of vestibular endorgans (utricular and saccular maculae) and measure these endorgans in space by means of a small computer system and software that we developed. As well as obtaining the dimensions--such as length and area--of the utricular and saccular maculae, we also found that (1) most of the utricular macula lies in one plane, which is the same as the plane of the lateral semicircular canal, (2) the saccular macula is shaped like part of a sphere, and (3) the angle between the two maculae is less than a right angle. Such knowledge is indispensable to the evaluation of the function of the utricular and saccular maculae.

%X This study was performed to clarify the complex three-dimensional shape of the round window and its membrane, and to measure these structures by using the computer-aided three-dimensional reconstruction method we developed. The equipment used included a personal computer, a high- resolution, 14-inch color monitor, and a digitizer. Materials consisted of five normal temporal bones obtained from five individuals with negative otologic histories who had been 5 months and 14, 15, 18, and 59 years old at death. Round window membranes were found to be convex to the middle ear side when viewed in the coronal plane, but to be concave when viewed in the sagittal plane; thus the membrane in most cases seemed to be shaped like a saddle, tapered toward the vestibular end. The average maximal diameter, sagittal length, horizontal width, and surface area of the round window were 2.32 +/- 0.19 mm, 2.08 +/- 0.22 mm, 1.76 +/- 0.10 mm, and 2.70 +/- 0.43 mm2, respectively. The average surface area of the round window membrane was 2.98 +/- 0.43 mm2.

%X A computer reconstruction method was used to study five normal temporal bones for the three-dimensional anatomy necessary for singular neurectomy. The length of the singular canal was 4.9 +/- 0.6 mm. The distal portion of the singular canal courses at a sharp angle (48.2 degrees) to the direction of the transmeatal surgical approach for this operation. The reconstructions indicated that the singular canal can be exposed by introducing a drill through the external auditory meatus at a point 0.71 mm posteroinferior to the posteromedial margin of the round window on the saucerized medial wall of the round window niche. The distance from this site to the distal end-portion of the singular canal averaged 1.47 mm. The point on the drilling course (from the drilling site to the singular canal) closest to the vestibular end of the hook portion of the cochlea was 0.48-1.00 mm from the drilling site. The reconstructions also indicated that the dissection should proceed superomedially, if necessary, after a 1-mm-deep straight dissection along the transmeatal approach. The ampulla of the posterior semicircular canal, cochlear aqueduct and inferior cochlear vein were all found to lie within 2 mm of the drilling point.

%X We studied the relation between vestibular functions and neurological diagnosis in 477 brain damaged infants and children who had delayed gross motor functions. They were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 319 infants with cerebral palsy in the first year of life, and Group 2 consisted of 158 brain damaged children up to 4 years of age. The damped-rotation test was used to evaluate vestibular function and the number of perrotatory nystagmus were measured. In Group 1 there were 24 infants with no vestibular responses, including two who were deaf. Five of those in Group 1 showed no responses at the first year of life but normal responses as they developed. In Group 2, all had normal vestibular responses. These results show that the incidence of no vestibular response is very high in infants with spastic cerebral palsy.

%X Technologic progress in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D Page), in combination with immunoblotting, amino acid sequencing, and computer-assisted image analysis, allowed establishment of human body fluid and tissue "reference maps," which in turn enabled meaningful comparison of data from various clinical and research centers. Altered protein profiles have been observed in plasma/serum, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and other body fluids in numerous systemic or localized pathologic entities. Human perilymph, obtained during ear surgery or post mortem, exhibits a protein profile differing from plasma in several ways. Most interesting are the extremely high levels of high density lipoprotein-associated proteins, a group of proteins thought to play a role in atherosclerosis, nerve damage/regeneration, chronic inflammation, and Alzheimer's disease, among others. A technique is described for collection and analysis of human perilymph, using a state-of-the-art standardized 2-D Page technique. It is expected that, as in other body fluids, disease- specific protein patterns will be identified. With the possible exception of presumed perilymphatic fistula, it is not envisioned that analysis of perilymph will be used for diagnostic purposes but rather as an aid for the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying inner ear disease, whether localized or as part of systemic alterations.

%X Familial dysautonomia, or Riley-Day syndrome, is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and occurs almost exclusively in Jewish families. This disorder is characterized by a smooth tongue devoid of fungiform papillae and of taste buds, and is clinically associated with poor taste discrimination. An unsteady gait and dizziness on change in position are also common presenting symptoms. This study reports the histopathological findings of eight temporal bones from four patients with documented familial dysautonomia. For the control series, 13 normal temporal bones were also studied. The most striking finding in the dysautonomic patients was an extreme paucity of geniculate ganglion cells (P less than 0.001). A statistically significant reduction in the number of neurons was also found both in the superior and in the inferior divisions of the vestibular nerve (P less than 0.001). The paucity of the geniculate ganglion cells correlates well with the impairment of the taste in dysautonomic individuals, since the afferent fibers leaving taste buds of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue run via the chorda tympani and have their cell bodies in the geniculate ganglion. Furthermore, the reduction in the number of Scarpa's ganglion cells observed in the dysautonomic patients studied here could account for a poor response to caloric test, positional vertigo and an unsteady gait in this condition.

%X Hearing loss due to malformations of the auditory system may involve morphologic abnormalities of the external canal, the middle ear, or the inner ear. Various combined malformations are possible. Audiologic assessment and computed tomography make it possible to perform a precise diagnostic evaluation of inner ear malformations. In a series of 71 children with congenital sensorineural hearing loss, 31 had computed tomographic evidence of malformations. Since 19 children had bilateral lesions, a total of 50 ears were studied. The cochleovestibular abnormalities were typed and correlated to the severity and progression of hearing impairment. The 3 most frequently encountered malformations were: 1) isolated large cochlear aqueduct (n = 12), 2) large vestibular aqueduct (n = 8) and 3) the Mondini malformation (n = 7). The most severe hearing losses were associated with cochlear hypoplasia and incomplete cochlear segmentation. The severity of hearing impairment decreased with the following abnormalities in the order given: 1) large cochlear aqueduct, 2) Mondini malformation and 3) large vestibular aqueduct. Among the 15 patients with progressive hearing loss, 13 had large cochlear aqueducts either isolated or concomitant with other lesions. While certain evident abnormalities, such as cochlear aplasia or Mondini malformation, are relatively easy to diagnose, other more subtle morphologic changes, such as large cochlear aqueduct, still need to be better defined according to precise criteria for radiographic evaluation.

%X To record the electro-oculogram in infants without using general anesthesia and passive globe rotation, we used the static vestibular reflex in which compensatory eye movements occur in response to angular rotation of the semicircular canal. To produce these eye movements, we placed the infant in a supine position in his mother's arms in a rocking chair and, while he nursed from a bottle, directed his attention to a distracting stimulus. We recorded the electro-oculogram during rocking under conditions of light and dark adaptation. We used the electro-oculograms to calculate the conventional light-to-dark amplitude ratio.

One patient had a high rectovaginal fistula, but in the other 11 cases the tract opened into the bowel uniformly at the level of the levator ani (anorectal-vestibular fistula). In these patients, diagnosis of the anatomical level of the fistula was made definitely with our radiological technique. Excision of not only the fistulous tract but also the anterior half of the rectum below the fistula is essential to achieve a cure without recurrence. The pathogenesis of this condition is discussed and the pertinent literature reviewed.

%X A study of the development of hereditary anorectal malformations in pig embryos resulted in major corrections of all current theories concerning normal and abnormal anorectal development. The principal event in anorectal development proved to be a shift of the dorsal part of the cloaca and the adjacent gut to the body surface of the tail groove. Regression of the dorsal part of the cloacal membrane forms an essential part in this process. Agenesis of this part to the membrane blocks the normal shift of the anorectum of the body surface with anorectal malformation as the result. The subtype of anomaly appeared to depend on the size and the form of this defect. Thus, small defects resulted in stenotic, ectopic perineal, and vulvar/vestibular orifices, and larger defects led to anal and anorectal agenesis. In all cases, an ectopic anal communication ("fistula") to the skin or the urogenital system developed but this was eventually lost in some cases by epithelial regression. A basic similarity between man and pig in both the normal development of the anorectum and in the morphology of the anorectal anomalies makes it likely that the same pathogenetic principle also applies to man. Deformities of the cloacal membrane may also form the basis of other congenital malformations of cloaca-derived orifices such as hypospadia, epispadia, vesical and cloacal extrophy, double urethra, and cloacal membrane agenesis.

%X The authors report 33 cases of meningitis treated with intrathecally administered gentamicin (GM) and examine it's effectiveness for meningitis side effects and optimum dose. Of 33 cases 15 cases (group I1 were treated with GM alone 7 cases (group IIa) with GM combined with SB--PC or CP. In 8 cases of the other 11 cases (group IIb) GM was changed for SB--PC or CP because of it's inefficiency and side effects (6 cases) and other reasons (2 cases). In the remaining three cases of group IIb SB--PC or CP was changed for GM due to their inefficiecy. Maximum intrathecal dose is shown below : 4 mg--7 cases, 8 mg--5 cases, 10 mg--15 cases, 20 mg--4cases, 40 mg--2 cases. In all cases GM was not administered systemically, but each of CP, CB--PC, SB--PC and TC was administereed systemically. In group I, only one case did not G--I tract bleeding but the others were cured. In group IIa all but one case was cured. In group IIb one case of cyptococcosis was dead. Total effective cases of intrathecal GM were 17 of 24 cases excluding group IIa (7 cases) and 3 cases of group IIb. There was no side effect in cases of which maximum dose was 4--20 mg, but in one of 40 mg administered cases in which GM was injected from cisternal puncture hearing, vestibular and visual function were disturbed permanently. Therefore GM should not be injected into the cistern. In our conclusion intrathecal GM is thought to be effective in the treatment of meningitis without systemic GM. Effective optimum dose in 4--8 mg/day day in adult and if ineffective after 7--10 days GM should be changed for other antibiotics.

%X Vestibular fistula and perineal ectopic anus are the most common anorectal malformations in female children. Anterior saggital anorectoplasty (ASARP) was used to treat 416 patients with these anomalies, as well as cases of perineal canal and third-degree perineal tear, during a 20 year period. Preliminary colostomy was performed in only four patients, who had a perineal tear. For ASARP, a midline incision was made and the rectum was separated from the vagina and placed in the center of the sphincteric muscle complex. The perineal body was reconstructed, and normal appearance of the perineum was achieved. Six patients had complications postoperatively (4 had secondary hemorrhage, 2 had wound infection). One patient with hemorrhage and one with infection required laying open of the wound and revision surgery after 12 weeks. Both recovered well. Of the 416 patients, 397 returned for follow-up 12 weeks after the surgery. Of these, 390 had a normal-looking perineum and normal defecation. Of the remaining seven patients, three had retraction of the rectum, one had recurrence of the fistula, and another had acquired perineal canal. These five children required revision ASARP and recovered successfully. The other two patients had mucosal prolapse, which reduced spontaneously. Three hundred twenty-six children of the 416 patients have had follow-up beyond the age of 3 years. Of these, 291 had normal bowel habits without the use of laxatives. Of the other 35, four had fecal impaction of unknown etiology, which was managed conservatively, 6 had anal stenosis (four underwent posterior Barrow's flap interposition and two responded to dilatation), and 25 had a posterior ledge that caused constipation and required cutback. Overall, eight patients (1.9%) required revision ASARP and 40 others (9.8%) had minor complications. This operation provides consistently good results, and the authors recommend it for the management of anorectal malformations and perineal trauma in female children.

%X OBJECTIVES To correlate renal function with the site of the ectopic orifice in patients with a single ectopic ureter and to evaluate the role of ureteric reimplantation in the preservation of renal function. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients (41 female, age 1.5 months to 20 years) with a single ectopic ureter have been managed in our institution in the last 21 years. The classical symptom of continuous wetting with intermittent normal micturition was reported in most of the female patients. The investigative evaluation included intravenous urography (i.v.U), cysto-urethroscopy, vaginoscopy with retrograde ureteric catheterization, micturating cysto-urethrography (MCU) and ultrasonography. Diuretic renography was carried out in four patients after it became available in 1992. Renal function was assessed in relation to urinary tract anomalies and with outcome after ureteric re- implantation. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (two males) had a unilateral ectopic ureter; the ectopic orifice was vaginal in 12, vestibular in 11, urethral in nine, at the bladder neck in two, the seminal vesicle in one and undetermined in three. Twenty-one patients had renal and/or ureteric abnormalities, with reflux detected on MCU in three ureters. Associated anomalies included hypospadias (two, one female), skeletal anomalies (two), anorectal malformations (three), cryptorchidism (two), and unilateral cystic ovary (one). Two patients had preoperative hypertension. In 15 patients, renal function was considered sufficient to justify ureteric reimplantation, 14 of whom regained continence. One girl had suprapubic leakage from the bladder and died during secondary nephroureterectomy. Another girl had persistent incontinence; she was found to have contralateral duplex ureters with a vestibular ectopic orifice and was cured after upper polar heminephroureterectomy. i.v.U and renography carried out in two patients each within 4 weeks of surgery showed a moderate improvement in renal function. Eight patients reported for follow-up after ureteric reimplantation (mean duration 11 months); none had hypertension or urinary infection. Twenty-three patients with rudimentary kidneys underwent nephroureterectomy. Histopathological examination of the excised kidneys showed moderate to severe dysplasia with chronic pyelonephritis. Six patients (one male) had bilateral single ectopic ureters, with normal renal function in the five females. Unilateral reimplantation in the boy resolved the symptoms; one girl died before surgery and the other four underwent bilateral ureteric reimplantation, after which one was dry for up to 3 h while the other three were incontinent, one of whom subsequently underwent urinary diversion. CONCLUSIONS: There was no clear correlation of renal function with the site of the ectopic ureteric orifice, as most of the patients with a vaginal ectopic ureter had sufficient renal function to justify renal preservation. Ureteric reimplantation preserved renal function, although the improvement after surgery was determined by the degree of renal dysplasia.

%P 166-72
%X Although evidence shows that victims of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) suffer repetitive episodes of hypoxemia, only subtle abnormalities have been found in their brains by light microscopy. The aim of the present study was to determine whether apoptosis, a form of cell death that can be triggered by hypoxemia and that leaves no scarring detectable by light microscopy, would be present in hypoxia- sensitive brain regions of SIDS victims. We looked for the presence of apoptosis with an in situ end-labeling method that detects DNA fragmentation. We studied 29 SIDS victims who were age-matched to nine control cases. We found significant neuronal apoptosis in 79% of the SIDS cases: 55% of the cases positive in the hippocampus and 96% positive in the brainstem. Whereas the distribution of apoptosis in the hippocampus was in hypoxia-sensitive subregions, the distribution in the brainstem was mostly in dorsal nuclei, including those involved with sensation in the face and position of the head (nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract and vestibular nuclei). The control cases showed no significant apoptosis in the hippocampus and a mild degree in the brainstem in three cases. Our results indicate the occurrence of an acute insult at least several hours before death, an insult from which the infants had apparently recuperated. This suggests that SIDS victims suffered repeated apoptosis resulting in significant neuronal damage and, thus, functional loss in key brain regions. The involvement of specific nuclei in the brainstem may be linked to the fact that prone sleeping is a significant risk factor for SIDS. Enhanced neuronal death by apoptosis may thus have major implications for understanding the sequence of events leading to SIDS.

Studies are included that relate to changes in the vestibulo-ocular reflex with age, effects of vestibular stimulation on smiling, crying, general activity, and visual attentiveness of infants; and studies that show that typical sequelae to vestibular stimulation are reduced following long-term stimulation. The importance of reviews of the literature and transference of research results to therapeutic use are stressed, with the implication that vestibular-based therapy will improve as occupational therapists become more aware of related research.

%X External ophthalmoplegia, retinal pigmentary degeneration and heart block constitute the trias of Kearns-Sayre's syndrome. The aetiology of this disorder of oxidative metabolism is unknown. This syndrome must be more frequent than described. In the ENT field there is an extensive lack of differentiated data. Central neural and peripheral hearing disorders and vestibular disorders are in fact significant, as are also dysphagia, hoarseness and dysarthria in consequence of central and peripheral disorders in muscular function. The authors report on ENT findings in 4 patients with verified Kearns-Sayre's syndrome. Progression of central disorders enhances an unfavourable prognosis. Histochemical, biochemical and electron microscopic data are still lacking for the proper grading and assessment of clinical findings.

%X The development of the parachute reaction as a postural response has been tested under various optic stimuli in normal and statomotorically retarded infants. Complete reaction consists in symmetric extension of the arms with extension and spreading of the fingers on quick approach to visual surface. Using a glass plate with three different sized stimulus patterns the parachute response is scored as complete or incomplete. The complete reaction to large visual surface develops significantly earlier than to small visual surface. The response also requires simultaneously a visual and a vestibular sensory input. The developmental course of the parachute reaction is statistically significant linear correlated in double logarithmic transformation to the stimulus pattern and to the age indicating a complex biological maturating process. When the whole retinal area was stimulated by moving visual scenes similar to normal environmental conditions the reaction starts with about 4 months of age and is fully developed from 9 months onwards. The time of quickest development is around 6.3 months of age, a period where locomotor abilities shift from horizontal postiion to active verticalisation of the body. In statomotorically retarded infants the response develops significantly later according to their active motor behaviour. Brain integration and computing centers of sensory afferent input could be multilevel from reticular formation to cerebral cortex, wherein the latter, probable the parietal lobe should play the major role. It is concluded that the parachute reaction results from a combined visuovestibular mechanism of interaction in connection with sufficient kinesthetic experience in visuo-motor behaviour.

%X Children with many types of motor dysfunction have problems maintaining postural stability. Because maintenance of postural stability is an integral part of all movements, therapists evaluate and treat to improve postural stability in these children. This article reviews current pediatric assessment tools for postural stability and issues affecting testing this construct in children. The tests and measurements are classified according to their testing purpose and the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research disablement framework, focusing on the impairment and functional limitation dimensions. Postural stability is defined from a systems perspective with tests related to the sensory, motor, and biomechanical systems described. Reliability and validity information on the measurements is discussed. Relatively few measurements of postural stability in children are available that have acceptable reliability and validity documentation. Suggestions for research on test development in this area are discussed.

%X Three cases of N-type anorectal malformations have been encountered. Two girls with anorectal-vestibular fistulas (one with a normal anus and the other with mild stenosis) were typical of 15 other such cases in the literature. A boy with an anorectal-urethral fistula and covered anus had a lesser variant than most of the other 8 males in the literature. The frequently accompanying esophageal, renal, and skeletal anomalies were not present, nor did he have anterior urethral hypoplasia. The constellation of other major associated anomalies in the boys, but not in the girls, follows the pattern of other types of anorectal malformations and suggests an earlier and/or more severe teratogenic insult in the boys. Anterior perineal resection of the fistula is appropriate for girls with N-type fistulas and for those boys with normal anterior urethras. An additional urethroplasty is necessary for boys with anterior urethral hypoplasia. Our experience and that from the literature suggest that N-type anorectal malformations constitute a rare but real entity, akin to N-type tracheoesophageal fistulas. A plea is made that they be included in classifications of anorectal anomalies.

%X Thirty-three mother-infant pairs were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control, talking, or interactive (RISS). The later treatment included massage, talking, eye contact and rocking. The intervention (RISS) was administered to determine whether mothers and their preterm infants who actively interacted with each other would differ on later maternal and infant behaviors. The talking and RISS treatments were administered at specified time intervals 24 hours after delivery. Prior to hospital discharge, mother-infant interaction was assessed during a feeding. Significant differences were identified among the three groups for maternal (p less than .03) and infant (p less than .05) behaviors. These results suggest that active maternal interaction with the premature infant may enhance specific components of mother-infant interaction.

%X The neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) environment may interfere with the maturation and organization of premature infants' central nervous systems and may fail to meet these infants' developmental needs. In particular, immature distance receptors (i.e., hearing and vision) may receive overwhelming stimulation, whereas more mature tactile and vestibular pathways receive little stimulation. Furthermore, research on fetal learning suggests that the NICU environment should sensitively address requirements for learning by providing contingent experience. Nurses are ideally suited to reorganize the NICU and intervene to optimize infants' growth and development.

%X PURPOSE: To examine the immediate responses of preterm infants to two forms of unimodal [auditory only (A) and tactile only (T)] and two forms of multimodal sensory stimulation [auditory, tactile and visual (ATV); auditory, tactile, visual and vestibular (ATVV)]. METHOD: A convenience sample of 54 clinically stable preterm infants (33-34 postconceptional weeks) was randomly assigned to 1 of 5 experimental groups [Control (C); (A); (T); (ATV); and (ATVV)]. Stimulation was applied for 15 minutes once daily for 4 consecutive days. RESULTS: Outcome measures included pulse (PR) and respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation, behavioral state (BS), and body temperature. Repeated measures ANOVA identified significant differences among the groups during intervention for PR (p < .001), RR (p = .01), and BS (p < .02). Infants receiving any intervention with a tactile component showed increasing arousal (change in BS), and increased PR and RR during stimulation. Group T infants had higher proportions of PR > 180 while Group ATVV had higher proportions of PR < 140 (p = .0001). Group ATVV showed increased alertness following stimulation (24%) in contrast to having the least alertness during stimulation (11%). CONCLUSIONS: Tactile stimulation alone may be too arousing for these infants while the addition of vestibular stimulation may modulate arousal and facilitate optimal arousal prior to feeding.

%X In order to determine the characteristics of the vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VORs) as a function of age and posturo-motor development, a group of 26 normal children (6 to 25 months old) were tested at three different stages of posturo-motor control: prior to as well as during the first attempts to walk without support, and during the first year of independent walking. The test consisted of electro-oculographic (EOG) recordings of the VOR responses to horizontal semi-circular canal and otolith stimulations. The canal VOR was elicited in seated subjects by rotatory impulsions about a vertical axis (acceleration and deceleration both at 40 degrees/s2, separated by a rotation at 60 degrees/s velocity). The otolith VOR was elicited by inclining the rotating chair by 9 degrees respect to gravity. For the canal VOR, the time constant and the highest initial slow phase velocity were measured. The otolith VOR was characterized by the amplitude of the modulation and the bias (offset of baseline from zero) of the slow phase velocity averaged over 10 to 20 rotation cycles, for both the horizontal and vertical components of the response. The pooled values of these data show that canal VOR parameters did not vary significantly either with age of the children or with their stage of posturo-motor control. However, the otolith VOR parameters changed during the period of learning to walk: the modulation of the horizontal component increased and the modulation of the vertical component decreased significantly. Thus the ability to walk without support is marked by a significant change in the otolith but not canal responses; since the vestibular sensory organs develop anatomically at the same rate these results indicate that central nervous system processors of canal and otolith information develop independently.

%X In an acoustico-vestibular follow-up investigation of 91 four- to six- year-old children with birth weight below 2000 g, the same incidence of sensorineural hearing loss (19%) was found in 54 children treated with kanamycin in the neonatal period as in a group of 37 infants not treated with kanamycin. When comparing a group of children treated with both kanamycin and incubator (54 children) with a group treated with incubator only (16 children), no definite signs of synergism between incubator noise and kanamycin were found. However, the 5 cases of moderate or severe hearing loss all belonged to the group treated with both incubator and kanamycin. These 5 children had more severe neonatal complications, especially apnea, cyanotic spells and hyperbilirubinemia, which may increase the severity of the hearing loss. Among 56 incubator treated children with normal hearing (ISO standards) 52% had an audiogram pattern suggesting minor noise-provoked cochlear lesions. Among 18 non-incubator treated children with normal hearing only one child (6%) had a similar pattern. It should be stressed, however, that these children had no clinical symptoms of hearing loss.

%X Cephalic neural crest cells contribute to the formation of the external and middle ears, the supporting cells of the statoacoustic ganglion, other cranial nerve components, and the face. The anlage of otic sensory structures receive inductive stimuli from adjacent rhombencephalic tissue. The complex series of interactions that guide organogenesis of the outer, middle, and inner ear structures may explain why neurologic dysfunction is likely to be associated with malformations of the ear. We reviewed the records of 100 patients with complex ear anomalies with or without hearing loss. Mean age was 4.2 years (range 1 day-27 years). Malformations, either bilateral (70) or unilateral (30), involved the external ear (94), middle ear (16), and/or inner ear (12). Eighty-five patients had neurologic dysfunction. Cranial nerve dysfunction was found in 56 patients and involved nerves VIII (39 auditory and/or vestibular), VII (22), II (11), VI (8), V (4), III (3), X (3), XII (1), and IX (1). Sixty-four patients had evidence of central nervous system dysfunction such as mental deficiency/developmental delay (44), non-paretic gait disorders (17), hypotonia (16), microcephaly (13), seizures (8), motor deficits (8), autistic features (7), and radiographically confirmed intracranial abnormalities (5). Eleven of 19 children with hypoactive vestibules had delayed motor development or poor balance. Seventy-four patients had anomalies in other organ systems: 56 craniofacial, 28 osseous, 19 cardiac, 16 genito-urinary, 14 ocular, 11 gastrointestinal, and 7 cutaneous. Sixty-one patients had syndromic conditions, 32 of them branchial arch syndromes. The level of cognitive competence was not related to severity of craniofacial, ear, or cranial nerve abnormality. Children with ear malformations deserve neurologic and pediatric evaluations in addition to an otologic work-up.

%X Scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, and x-ray powder diffraction were used to study temporal bone specimens obtained at autopsy from an infant with Potter syndrome and from a second trimester fetus, which was the product of an elective abortion. The mothers of both the infant and fetus were juvenile-onset rheumatoid arthritis patients who took prostaglandin inhibitors during pregnancy. The infant's external ears were low set and the left ear canal was stenotic. The vestibular maculae on the left were covered by aberrant otoconia composed of vaterite. In the right inner ear, otoconia were entirely absent, although the gelatinous otoconial membranes were intact. Only the left saccule and right utricle from the fetus were studied; both contained vaterite crystals similar to those in the infant. In addition, apatite was present in the fetal utricle, apparently lying on the macula beneath the vaterite otoconia.

%X Two cases of trisomy 18 in which temporal bone defects were limited to the inner ears are described. Several abnormalities were present that have not been described previously in this syndrome. The first case involved a 1-month-old female infant who died of congenital heart defects. Cochlear nerve fibers were absent on the left side, with near- normal innervation on the right. Although the organ of Corti was present bilaterally, some of the outer hair cells were deformed, having small rounded cell bodies unsupported by Deiters' cells. On the right, similar abnormal cells were found in the tunnel of Corti. Vestibular defects in this case included reduced nerve supply of the left saccular macula, cysts in the superior and posterior cristae, and absence of the utriculoendolymphatic valve. The second case involved a newborn male infant with multiple congenital anomalies. The major cochlear defect was a deformity of the stria vascularis. In the lower apical turn, the stria was adherent to Reissner's membrane and extended beneath it into scala media. Large capillaries, which ran freely suspended in scala vestibuli, entered the upper portion of the stria. Severe atresia of the lateral and posterior semicircular ducts was found in the vestibular apparatus.

%X Eye movements were studied in a sister and brother with familial, congenital paralysis of horizontal gaze. Horizontal and vertical eye movements were recorded with DC electro-oculography and analyzed with a laboratory computer. All horizontal, conjugate eye movements were absent (saccades, pursuit, optokinetic nystagmus, vestibulo-ocular response, and visual-vestibular responses). Voluntary vergence eye movements were preserved and were used to track visual targets. An involuntary, horizontal, pendular nystagmus was found to represent disconjugate, smooth, vergence eye movements. Vertical saccades and vestibulo-ocular responses were normal. However, vertical pursuit, optokinetic nystagmus, and suppression of the vestibulo-ocular response by fixation were impaired. A developmental anomaly affecting motor neurons and interneurons in the abducens nuclei is suggested to be the cause of the absence of conjugate, horizontal eye movements.

They showed growth failure, psychomotor deterioration, deafness, vestibular dysfunction, microcytic hypochromic anemia, abnormal ratios of lymphocyte subpopulations, and slightly decreased bicarbonate on blood gas analysis. Distal renal tubular acidosis was demonstrated in one of them. Carbonic anhydrase II activity was normal. This new hereditary disease might have a defect in a molecule that is present in brain, spinal cord, kidney and hematocytes and is involved in H+/HCO3- production or transport.

%X The electroretinogram (ERG) is the only test currently available that has the potential to identify patients with Usher syndrome before onset of fundoscopic and visual abnormalities. The ERG is a noninvasive technique that can diagnose retinitis pigmentosa via measurement of corneal-retinal potentials. Forty-seven children with bilateral severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss were evaluated. Usher syndrome was diagnosed in five children, all of whom subsequently underwent cochlear implantation. We have found that accurate diagnosis of Usher syndrome in infants and young children is possible via ERG. Benefits of early diagnosis include timely counseling regarding genetic issues, educational and vocational placement, and cochlear implantation. For this reason we recommend that all newly identified children with bilateral severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss undergo ERG testing.

%X OBJECTIVE: To determine if all children with enlarged vestibular aqueducts (EVAs) have development of uniform progressive sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). To determine whether the size of the EVA correlates with severity, frequencies involved, and stability of SNHL. To determine if the audiologic pattern of SNHL correlates with likelihood of progression of SNHL. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC, a tertiary care center with a large otologic practice. PATIENTS: Fifteen children (26 ears) with EVA on computed tomographic scan. METHODS: History, physical examination, computed tomographic scans, and serial audiograms were reviewed. Factors analyzed included age at diagnosis, audiometric configuration (high tone, midtone, low tone, flat), degree of hearing loss at presentation, length of follow-up, and presence of associated inner ear anomalies. RESULTS: Nine ears had progressive SNHL, 16 ears had stable SNHL, and 1 ear had profound SNHL. The predominant audiologic configuration was flat. The audiogram configuration does not correlate with progression of SNHL. The size of the vestibular aqueduct does not correlate with the level, type, or progression of SNHL. CONCLUSION: Our study failed to uncover factors that might be predictive of progression of hearing loss. We conclude that until a better understanding of the natural history and pathophysiologic condition of EVAs is achieved, there is no surgical or other intervention that can be demonstrated as being efficacious.

%X The pharmacokinetics and dosage requirements of gentamicin were studied in 1,640 patients receiving treatment for gram-negative infections. A wide interpatient variation in the kinetic parameters of the drug occurred in all patients and in patients who had normal serum creatinine or normal creatinine clearance. The half-life ranged from 0.4 to 32.7 h in 331 patients who had normal creatinine clearance. The factors related to the elimination rate constant were creatinine clearance, age, distribution volume, weight, gender, and hematocrit. The daily dose necessary to obtain therapeutic serum concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 25.8 mg/kg in patients with normal serum creatinine and from 0.7 to 25.8 mg/kg in patients with normal creatinine clearance. In 13 patients (0.9%), a significant change in base-line serum creatinine (greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/dl) occurred during or after treatment, which may have been gentamicin-associated toxicity. Overt cochlear or vestibular toxicity did not occur in these patients. The method of individualizing dosage regimens provided a clinically useful means of rapidly attaining therapeutic peak and trough serum concentrations.

%X Hearing loss and CT findings of 200 ears from 102 cases with congenital malformation of inner ear were included in our study. Hearing loss was typically bilateral severe, or total deafness. 75 percent of them were found deaf within one-year-old. In addition, 47 patients' (46%) mothers were noted to have caught a cold in first trimester of pregnancy. Temporal bone abnormalties were described as five types: 1. Michel malformation, 2. Mondini malformation, 3. enlargement of the vestibular aqueducts, 4. developmental deformity of cochlear aqueduct, 5. developmental deformity of internal acoustic meatus. Most cases showed malformations of vestibule or vestibular aqueducts.

%X In labyrinthitis ossificans the membranous labyrinth and the endosteum are obliterated by pathological ossification. The pathogenesis, differential diagnosis and radiological findings of a case of labyrinthitis ossificans caused by pneumococcal meningitis are described. The destructive process in the membranous labyrinth can be shown by radiology. The importance of early diagnosis for rehabilitation of hearing loss after treatment is demonstrated.
